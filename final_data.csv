0,"Yet another complaint about HP Smart Printer software.  It's not fit for purpose.  I've wasted days going around in circles with a printer that refuses to enable printing services until it is activated, however you can't obtain a pairing code to activate it.Eventually got through to HP support who said this printer has a dedicated team (that's a bad sign!) after a further 30 minutes on hold I eventually got through to someone who said everyone was busy and they'd call me back.  That was 2 days ago (and counting).  The printers are not fit for purpose and from the looks of it, they know it all too well but are burying their head in the sand.  HP are a discrace"
1,"HP MFP 4101fdwe DO NOT PURCHASEThis product does not connect to the HP Smart app, does not connect to the internet, and customer support has hung up on me over 10 times without answering my calls.  Edit: someone called me back and spoke to me over an hour, but did not solve my problem or offer any potential solutions.  Does not revise upward my rating."
2,2 Broken printers from manifacture. 5 hours of time wasted. The only offer refurbished printers to replace an existing one even if its a week old. Instant ink is also very poor.Sends a new one before the old has depleted and it could be half full. Aweful experieance an i am a computer tech.
3,"Following up from my last review, case was accelerated.  Contacted by customer service who were incredible. Great outcome despite the stressful days of trying to sort out my issue. New cartridge sent and arrived. Thank you"
4,"I have bought onsite support. My laptop will not start so I contacted HP support. They ordered a UPS pick-up, not onsite support. UPS arrived but did not have the collection box. They said they would be back, but 2 working days later and no UPS. I have since tried every option available on the HP website and support email and there is no way to contact them at all. I get a circular process that ends in no way to complain or communicate in any way. Complete rubbish support."
5,"Thanks for the hp desktop, Printer and hp laptop. I found it in budget price, easy to function, zero serviceability, good looking, compact, availability of cartridge, laptop is a good one."
6,"It is slow as hell .I mean I would've understand it if it wasn't working high functioning tools like ae or genshin impact or any other thing. But bro settings? Even settings is lagging and you think the laptop will work.I wanted to on the night light but whenever I'm touching the night light ,it is chosen but is not opening even the whole setting app is just froze"
7,"Bought a HP Envy X360 laptop in October 2021.  The laptop has had light useage and is still in the condition it was purchased (excellent) apart from the hinge that holds the screen on the base has broken.  Was told that it would cost £440 to fix the hinge as it is a ""premium"" product.  The cost was for ""premium"" parts.  Obvious not premium parts used in the first place as it isn't fit for purpose.  I would not recommend HP as their after sales service is pants.  Never had such a bad service for such a ""premium"" product (HP's words - not mine)."
8,Continous issues with printer since orignal purchase. multiple attempts for contact to resolve issue with no resolves. Waste of money and waste of time.
9,"My HP/ Omen desktop was delivered with a defect. After appr. 6 month of repairing process, I was not able to support Omen and HP anymore with further reparation loops (same issue was tackled many times...). I cancelled the contract after the failed repairing process, but until now no response from HP or Omen. Really bad customer experience for a desktop > 2.500 EUR ... I would recommend everyone not buying at HP / Omen"
10,"A few years ago I bought an hp printer HP Deskjet 3050A e-All-in-One Printer. Used a few times, still had the original packing paper. The Scanner stopped working, it showed some colored stripes and did not scan. I tried contacting support and never got any help. I will never buy anything from HP again. They lost a customer for life and I will do anything to let people know what HP is all about."
11,"I bought an HP Deskjet printer 3760 in June 2022 (still under warranty) and recently had cartridge problems with it. HP agreed to replace it.  I had a lengthy conversation with someone called Ahmed in HP Customer Care who insisted on inserting the incorrect flat number despite me insisting it was the wrong number.  My mobile number was also displayed without a zero in front as is normal nor did it display the country code.  Again Ahmed kept insisting that the UPS delivery driver would know which country he is calling etc. etc. and would call me before he got to my flat.  I thought this was fishy business as companies are particular about giving the correct address and phone numbers.   On the day of delivery, I happened to look out my window and saw a white van arrive.  The driver approached the block and I heard a doorbell which wasn't mine.  I went outside and it was UPS with my printer and it had the incorrect flat number on the label.  I have not opened the box because I saw a sticker saying it is a ""refurbished"" printer.  It stays unopened until HP can give me a new-for-new replacement.  I have again contacted HP Customer Care via email (Ahmed) but I have not received a reply.  Fishy business going on at HP."
12,"They stopped my printer function because i did not subscribe to their ink purchase. After a representative previously told me I had free ink for the life of the printer, repeatedly. CREEPY YUK!!"
13,"On Saturday 24th December 2022, Christmas Eve I purchased an HP Officejet Pro 9020e 4-in-1 Printer from eBay for $382 from eBay so I can print heaps of images to iron on shirts also I can use it for personal and business use."
14,I read so many of the one star reviews and must take issue.  These folks go over and above the line in terms of customer service assistance.  Not only do the techs do everything they can to assist with your Laptop/PC issues but they follow up the next day.  Who does that.  Additionally when you call you get someone immediately.  No 4 hour wait.  These folks are outstanding in every way.
15,It is a sign of our times that this truly awful company is still in business. Their printers are beyond awful. Hard to find words in the English language to describe the dysfunctional workings of hp printers. They are set up to entrap people into buying and using more ink. They are set up to be as complicated as possible. The leadership of this company should be in prison.
16,"They can't solve even a single issue. I have been trying to enroll into their instant ink, its been a month but they cant fix it and moreover they stopped responding cos their shift got over. Hilarious."
17,"UK Support Line. In response to Mike Gee's request for a UK support number, I have contacted UK tech support on 02076606027. That is I believe a direct line. Or a more general line 02076602664. I have only used this in relation to a printer, but give it a go. I don't contact them now, as my printer is out of warranty. Not paying money for a bunch of ..........."
18,"Dead loss as per other reviewers. HP+ is a blatant rip off, I clicked on it before realising what it entailed. Now Im locked into free ink for 6 months with  options for future ink supplies based on usage (which I dont want/need). Im also forced to only use genuine HP cartridges, I dont mind this so much but its just so annoying to be TOLD I must use them. No way of removing HP+ either, once activated- always activated. Their monthly deals are not ink based but print based, so if you want to cancel at any time the ink cartridges stop working immediately regardless of amount of ink remaining. Obviously the lessons learned from the demise of Black & Decker and Flymo etc have been ignored. Treat customers with contempt and they simply go elsewhere - I intend to do just that. Then I decided to give them one last chance and contacted HP Post Sales - you would think they were a different company. Problem solved to my complete satisfaction within 24 hours - give them a try if you are unhappy with HP, Im glad I did."
19,"Useless printer, you need the HP app to get to work, but this app steals all yours data and forces you to a subscription. First 6 months are free but after that you have to pay and it is impossible to stop the subscription.Next to that, the connection keeps failing, so the printer is unreliable"
20,"May 4, 2023Awful experienceAwful experience. Ordered a laptop worth £900 and it never arrived. Spoke to customer services in the end and had to cancel the order. Now have to wait for a refund which I am told will take weeks. Absolute disgraceful serviceDate of experience: April 26, 2023"
21,"Apr 27, 2023HP Printers, app and customer service not fir for purposeBought an HP Envy 6000e for an elderly relative-thinking it would be simple and trouble free. Nothing could be further from the truth.Printer  was constantly stuck in offline mode. HP app worse than useless in solving. This is a known issue. Customer service from HP in UK in abysmal. The HP app makes it very difficult to cancel the ink subscription by deliberately hiding the cancel option. The app is slow, poorly written and buggy.HP used to be a flagship tech company which I generally trusted since the mid nineties onward.Not any more. HP are finished.Date of experience: December 03, 2022"
22,"May 6, 2023Disgraceful!The worst product and Customer Service I have ever received! The HP Envy 6020e broke down after only 12 days. This was bad enough, but what followed was disgraceful. The agent I spoke to took me through a 'fault finding' process which I had already done myself; with the same result - the printer was broken! Despite the fact that I was still within the ""18 day distance selling"" rules and the obvious fact the printer would not print, the agent refused my request for a new replacement. She told me HP only supply their refurbished printers, which I refused! When I asked for a refund, which, by Law I was entitled to, the agent refused this as well. Eventually the agent said that a Supervisor would telephone within an hour. More than a week later I am still waiting! Thankfully, I bought my product using PayPal, who gave me an instant refund. Why can't such a large, multinational company get even the basics right? When a printer breaks within the 12 months, which is part of the UK consumer rights act, just replace it. To consider sending a refurbished printer, particularly after only 12 days, is an insult to customers.Date of experience: April 18, 2023"
23,"May 3, 2023HP Technical Support AbysmalI bought a £900 HP ENVY X360 2-in-laptop 2 months ago but only  got round to using it recently... (I have 2 other laptops I use regularly and mostly wanted this one for photo-editing) Having set-it up I received notification of a windows 11 update so restarted it to install this but it didn't get beyond the HP logo... having done a hard restart I subsequently tried all possible advanced options including a factory reset, all to no avail... I contacted HP support (virtual assistant of course) using another laptop and after an hour of fruitless chat finally managed to get a contact for a live agent which is a US number! does anyone know of a UK support number I can use?Date of experience: May 03, 2023"
24,"May 6, 2023I bought a laptop direct from HP which…I bought a laptop direct from HP which needed repair twice at great expense in the end I sold it damaged for £100 after having it repaired once with Flextronics HP. Why would you leave impossible to remove stickers all over a laptop after repairing it? This was annoying. Needless to say I couldn't be bothered to repair the laptop the second time and had to sell it £100 after losing several hundred on the initial purchase and repair. It was a poor quality item that sustained unfortunate damage from a leaking roof which I can't really blame HP for however the second time the laptop became damaged I feel this was HP's fault because the repair wasn't conducted satisfactorily by Flextronics. It's a little confusing as to how a laptop could be damaged second time round and definitely a warranty issue but I was ignored and belittled by HP. I think I have learnt a lesson in transporting and handling high-value electronics nonetheless HP are not great a product. I wouldn't recommend HP for laptops.Date of experience: June 08, 2022"
25,"May 7, 2023rubbish printer, customer service rip offChanged wifi provider and the wifi printer will no longer work.  I have followed all the instructions to change wifi on the printer.  All you get from HP are useless webpages or an offer to sell ink.  I don't want ink i want someone to invest in their product and support so that it works.Now they want me to pay for support for a printer that is failing to work properly.

26,"May 4, 2023Absolutely HopelessAbsolutely no way of contacting HP by phone to ascertain the cost of returning a faulty laptop for investigation. I so fed up of filling in forms, creating accounts, adding devices, all for nothing - there's no way to contact HP other than installing a useless diagnostics app which proves nothing. Based on this experience, I will never purchase another HP product and I can wholeheartedly recommend that if you're reading this, STAY AWAY FROM HP!Date of experience: May 04, 2023"
27,"Updated May 2, 2023Absolutely horrid companyAbsolutely horrid company.  You buy an expensive printer only to encounter one problem after another and their customer service is laughable.  First of all ,they hardly speak English . Furthermore, they told me that my drivers had collapsed and in order to get the printer working again ,I would have to pay $99 for a technician! So I asked a friend of mine ,who is NOT a computer expert, to have a look at it and within minutes he had the printer working again . Right now I am on the phone ,having asked to speak to a supervisor about the""technician's"" incompetence and I was told to wait ""2 short minutes "" After 19 minutes of waiting on the phone ,the line went dead .

They charged me 65$ and I resolved the issue myself by asking questions! As the tech guy was not really aware of this issue. At the end, he told me its a hardware issue take it to best buy! I called other technicians and told the same story and they told me they need to see the hardware from beginning! So any expert level person will know that and I did not need to pay from beginning. They just wanted to sell the support subscription. No reimbursement after I told them, I was not happy with the service and the issue was not resolved.Date of experience: April 30, 2023"

I told him that I had anti-virus software; his response was anti-virus did not protect against Trojan Horse...  BS.... my computer is Windows, he said that only Apple computers protect against Trojan Horse; he must never have heard about Windows Defender.Anyway he tried to sell me anti-Trojan Horse software for get this $1,900.00 for a lifetime subscription..I told him no, and hung up.After the phone call I ran a complete scan on my computer....

I went though their stupid website and virtual assistant that wasted my time for about one hour. I then resorted to YOUTUBE and I found a video that told me how to reset my wireless (how amazing, a random guy on youtube managed to do a better job than the customer service of a multimillion company). I reset the device and when trying to reconnect it...surprise surprise...I am not allowed because it is still linked to their stupid instant ink. And I cannot remove it from instant ink (of course errors all the time...). The hilarious thing is that the printer was actually good and fast. Shame is delivered by this company. Would love to know who is the genius that devised such a stupid system...deserves a promotion as master clown....bottom line, I gave up and returned the printer and gone for another brand run by normal people...."
54,anyone who purchases an HP printer nowadays needs their head examined. They extort money from you by the monopoly they have on their super-expensive ink. Software updates regularly to prevent 3rd party ink cartridges being used. Problems when using AirPrint regularly. Printer not being recognised. Just garbage products and bad HP management. Just look at the negative and 1 * reviews. No backup. Zero useful support. I'm done with HP products forever now.
55,THEY CONTROL YOUR PRINTER AND YOU CANNOT USE IT AT ALL WITHOUT THEIR HORRIBLE LIFE LONG COMMITMENT TO THEIR INK SUPPLIER; YOU CANNOT USE YOUR PRINTER YOU PURCHASE UNTIL YOU GO THRU THEIR STUPID CALL CENTERS TO THE INSTA INK CO AND PURCHASE MORE INK WHETHER YOU NEED IT OR NOT. THEY TURN YOUR PRINTER OFF CONTINUOUSLY; YOU CANNOT USE IT AT ALL. WORST PRINTER IVE EVER PURCHASED BELOW ZERO ON RECOMMENDATION DO NOT BUY THESE GARBAGE MACHINES
56,Delinquent unacceptable standards. Make no mistake this company is very conniving and fraudulent. They have capability to impair your printer and ink cartridges remotely. Buy one of this and you'll be taken for an expensive ride.My understanding is that HP stand for hot poo and nothing more.STAY WELL AWAY !!!
57,"I purchased a £800 HP pavilion  pc when I came to register my product I found guarantee had expired before I even unpacked it. It starts when it leaves the factory. Rediculous.

59,"Absolutely shocking.  Waited nearly 1 HOUR to reach the sales ""advice"" line.  Trying to spend over £1k on a  replacement laptop. The previous HP x360 having exploded when the hinge severed wires holding the screen to the keyboard. On putting my pretty basic question to the ""advisor"" regarding the current hinge design of HP x360 laptops, (given this is a known issue),  he said ""I'm only a sales advisor, I don't know.  Try Tech support"". Tech support is only available if you have a serial number of an existing machine. Fortunately, I have already returned the dead laptop (to another retailer who is not an HP specialist).  So I have no serial number to enter. Calling this service ""sales advice"" is madness. The arrogant, rude, uneducated man (""Sean""), then told me he'd spent 10 minutes on the call and HUNG UP on me. Do not give your money to this company."
60,"My experience with HP printer 4100 is very bad, it does not connect , so basically never works. Money wasted. So poor customer service I have called 3 times, once was ok the guy tried very hard.

61,"Avoid purchasing a HP sprocket. At best it is an overpriced gimmick except in this instance the initial purchase is not inexpensive then you have the delight of the over-inflated consumables. If that was all it was, well caveatemptor but the quaity of the device and connectivity is terrible. I've printed less than 20 pictures and now the power supply is knackered and HP suggested buying a new one. Avoid"
62,"I recently purchased a new HP printer. I called support to help set it up with my computer. He took over my computer and proceeds to tell me everything wrong with it and how the drivers and security needs updated. Bottom line would not help me unless I bought a 3 year plan (almost $400) to protect my computer from hackers. I wasted 45 minutes with this person I just wanted a simple way to have my printer set up to my computer and got a sales pitch., and I can't help you unless you pay almost $400 for a plan. absolutely no help at all,"
63,"Wish I'd read these review before purchasing! While the HP Instant Ink service works well, the connectivity issues on the printer, especially for scanning, are terrible. The printer used to crash every time I tried to scan something, but at least a reboot made it work. Now, it just doesn't want to connect to the service and I can't use it at all. Very frustrating. Try something else first!!"
64,I tried calling HP support to complain about my HP All In One Desktop computer wireless dongle for the mouse and keyboard. I called the number after submitting the background information online. I called the number several times. I was either disconnected or received a recorded message that the line is temporarily unavailable. Poor support.
65,"I bought an HP Deskjet printer model 3712 from Currys a couple if years ago. Compared to an old Canon I have the HP printer is garbage. Barely use able. After hours of trying to connect it to a laptop or a mobile phone it very occasionally works. The HP Smart app does not recognise it most of the time. I think it could be to do with it wireless connections being poorly setup on the device. When trouble shooting all it does is print pages of information, over and over again. Should not have been sold in the first place. My first and last HP product. Seems to fare better when connected to an iPad  that's about it"
66,"Owned a few HP printers over the years. Always problems with connections, print jobs that don't come through and now today, after just buying WAY TOO EXPENSIVE INKT CARTRIGDES suddenly black stopped working. Do yourself a favour and never buy one of their products."

68,"Because of HP's on-line salespeople, their incompetence and out right lying, I don't have a computer and I don't have my money. They pushed my ship date back several weeks or later!

They are not returning my money, even though they still have the computer (at their factory) in their possession. I placed my order on March 21st and was guaranteed delivery on or before April 5th. Then I received an email that my delivery would be April 15th or later, they cannot guarantee a specific ship date. I must wait until after this nebulous timeline for them to even begin to process my refund. I have NEVER encountered such blatant disregard for customer care. What a horrible company HP turned out to be. I will NEVER purchase another HP again! What appalling customer service!"
69,"Having purchased two HP laptops prevuiosly, I was happy to use them again as my last one (7 years old) was sounding like a bag of spanners and kept snoozing. I had a look at the choice in a local electrical goods store and chose a HP Chromebook. The store was £100 more expensive so I purchased it fron the HP online store. It arrived within the allotted time.The keyboard is easy to use and responds well (I had to thump my last one but it was old!)I also purchased a HP printer around 12 years ago...it's still going strong but the ink is dearer than the printer originally cost so that is going into retirement soon and an alternative will be used.I have no complaint with this company and have found them extremely reliable and of good value"
70,"Terrible specs for the price. I bought a $600 laptop that only has a 3000mAh battery which was claimed as 'All day battery' when in reality it will only last about 3 or 4 hours less if you are doing intensive tasks. Specs are terrible with only 8gb of ram & 512gb of storage. HP is a terrible company that sells flawed and overpriced computers i will never buy another one from them. Their support is also atrocious, i submitted a ticket to them about an issue and even 6 months later I didn't get a single response from them."
71,"I jumped through hoops to get a customer service person on chat.I spent half an hour trying to get specs, and good explanations from this person.He knew next to nothing, and was pretty much useless.thanks Pradeep.Dont waste your time"
72,If you subscribe to the instant Ink program don’t assume you can go to a retailer & buy HP ink for your printer. They will continue to charge you every month for pages printed & not send you ink. If you complain there is no way you will get a credit in fact they sent a message to my printer that I was using unauthorized ink & I can not print anything.
73,Huge mistake buying HP laptop and extended warranty! Machine failures as soon as warranty ends. Trying to find parts information to replace failed parts is almost impossible. I have spent several hours trying to track down the part information to replace the battery. This should be fairly simple. Every other computers I have owned provide online resources for replacement parts.Obviously it is part of their strategy to force consumers to have repairs done only by HP. Just another act of greed. Kill greed!
74,Horrible customer support. Called them to ask some questions about printers and customer support couldn't tell me absolutely anything. I gave them certain models to look at and still couldn't give me more information. I found more info on youtube and google.
75,"When buying an HP OfficeJet 3831 I got enrolled on the Ink Subscription. First time I needed I was sent both black & colour cartridges which worked perfectly, more recently I was sent just 1 black cartridge which doesn’t work. I contacted them 4 weeks ago and not had any response. I would not buy from them again, new laptop I bought 3 months ago thankfully isn’t one of theirs."
76,"If I could rate it a zero, I would. Completely useless support. I bought a new HP all in one printer b/c they could not trouble shoot my old one. I have been unable to connect the new one to the internet and thus can""t scan from the printer. I have contacted HP support on THREE different occasions. Each time I am put on hold, transferred at least 3 times and then disconnected. It is impossible to deal with these people. NEVER AGAIN will I purchase an HP product!!!!!"
77,"This must be the worse customer services ever experienced. I purchased a laptop, which was faulty. Then received a replacement which was also faulty – which is both bizarre and questionable. Then I asked for return/refund as both were within 14 days. One laptop collected and one has STILL not been collected which was meant to be on 23/3 and despite emailing the CEO (also nonresponsive) I have been passed from pillar to post between post sales and tech support - causing untold calls and still no resolution. The services are dire, and it is not surprising their rating is so poor. They take the money quickly enough and treat customers with complete disrespect and am appalled at how they presume this is acceptable.Please DO NOT ever buy any of their products and avoid at all costs."
78,Sent my laptop in for repair 01/06/2023 it’s almost April. The technicians sent my laptop to another customer and it’s now being investigated. I haven’t been able to work from home due to my laptop being going for repair and I’m unable to buy another laptop due to the 500 was just spent out to HP for the laptop I only had 2 months! I will NEVER buy anything from them EVER again and will be filing a small claim in court to get my merchandise
79,"Ordered a laptop and it took almost 3-4 weeks for final delivery. Seems when you order, they send the information to a factory in China, then they build your laptop and then ship to the US. The slowest form of delivery I have ever seen for any purchase. Might as well buy it directly from China."
80,"HP sells laptops do not support docking stations for multiple displays. Technical support will waste your for week a week, tell you to purchase an HP docking station that doesn't work, before finally admitting the USB C port doesn't work. Then they'll charge you a 15% restocking fee. I will never purchase HP anything ever again"
81,After a horrendous computer experience with dell I bought an HP printer and had a problem setting it upA third party tech company HP use contacted me and said my computer neede a new licence (a lie) costing 300 pounds fo 5 years (the printer was about 60 pounds)They told me it was essential - i paid 100 pounds for a one year licence as I needed the printer urgently but then found it was a case of mis-selling and i had entered into a maintenance contract - requests for copy paperwork were ignoredNumerous emauls were ignoredThe only easaon I am not taking Court action is I live in Scotland and the case would require to be raised in England NEVER BUY HP KIT!!
82,"I have a laptop, purchaced at PCWorld, for years, and I have a nerve incident each time!! They have ""their own"" folders, if you save a file from the internet it doesn't go in ""My documents"", I tried to save a file (my P45 from 4 years ago from a website), it is just not there!! I tried to move between Downloads and Documents... FFS, that's a mission!  I am wondering why the space on my hard drive disappears???? Outrageous!! Just am attempt to ""create"" something different from any other IT company... NO! just make things easy!!!"
83,"I just purchased an go pavilion 15 and opening up it wanted an update. As soon as it finished it wiped out the wifi driver and I have spent 3 days wasting my time with their customer service support. I have been asked to pay for a usb drive$40 to fix it which I refused and they have sent me on purpose to every department (accounting, tech support 1, 2.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  I need this resolved today for an important conference in Monday and they could care less about it. I spent 3 hrs on hold today.  They promised a call back.  It has been 3 hrs and nothing.  I cannot believe HP considers this good customer relations"
84,I just bought this printer. After opening the box I realised it is much bigger than I have space for. It seems to handle A3 paper I just need A4. I immediately called HP to change it for a smaller one. I was informed the HP customer policy did not allow for a return nor a swop to another model . Be absolutely sure what you buy or buy from a company with a more customer oriented policy.
85,"I purchased this laptop in Nov 2020, fast forward March 2023 and the hinge is completely misaligned and the screen is popping out. One of my speakers work occasionally. This is my personal laptop that was hardly used, as I have a PC and work laptop - At most, it is used twice in a week. This laptop has never been dropped, and always been treated like a baby due to its fragile build, and yet it still manages to completely disassemble itself, which is amusing.I'm not saying this laptop is absolutely garbage, it has some unique features such as fingerprint reader and camera shutter. However, I would like to warn future customers to PLEASE BUY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY as even the most careful owner that hardly uses this laptop will still manage to somehow break it after 2.5 years.I submitted this same review on the official HP's website twice, but the review doesn't show up on the website. Interesting"
86,"HP LAPTOP BOUGHT FROM ARGOS WITH EXPENSIVE MANUFACTURER WARRANTYdo not buy HP, 1. I had to get a replacement and this process was ultra complicated (made to feel like a fraud) by both Argos and HP repairs manufacturers2. second relacement laptop (new) also useless, I notice that this Celeron model is no longer being sold, HP repairs accused me of breaking the laptop myself and will not repair it I ASSUME THAT THIS MODEL IS FAULTY"
87,"Worst printers known in existence. Never has worked, never will work! Absolutely no help from customer services, absolutely know guidance online. Manual says do this do that without any explanation as to how to do the thing in question they're asking. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!"
88,I will never buy an HP again.Constant run around from customer service with a warranted computer that keeps have a repair failure loop. I've reinstalled windows a dozen times but the computer reverts to the failure everytime. HP will waste your time doing troubleshooting until you lose your mind.
89,"Delivery agreed for a specific date but never arrived. Delivery rescheduled for a second date, but never arrived.They'll take your money but not give you what you paid for. Whoever is incharge of their logistics needs to be fired."
90,Worst technical support ever.No reps to Chat. I called and I was transferred to 5 different reps and no one could help me. unbelievable!! Can’t understand or comprehend how are they still in business. Gave it a 1 Star b/c 0 was not option. Very disappointing with HP!!!!!
91,"This companies leaders should be arrested and charged with the grand theft they continue to make. It takes an IT department everytime I want to print something from my content. Why do we have to get permission from outer space for me to print the neighbors a pic of their dog I just took. I'm 1 foot in front of the printer, can't find a network, no internet connection. Seriously Are they not content when my thoroughly raped ass, has to drop my head and go pay $100 for $3 worth of ink. Half of which will be wasted because the print preview looks nothing like the print. Of course that's if I get through the frustration of just getting the freaking thing to print. OMG What a sorry bunch of gangsters these a%$;#es are. I'd like to print and mail this, but I'm 60, I don't think there's enough time. It's an HP5200 this time, but throw a dart, they're all the same!"
92,"I bought my HP Officejet Pro8024e and subscribed to trial instant ink. I am an irregular user and decided not to proceed with a permanent subscription. HP remotely prevented my trial cartridges from working. I bought genuine shop new ones and fitted them. My printer has been ""validating"" for the last two hours. Customer Services (joke) is not available until Monday. Its was Friday at 17:11 when I called and the office closes at 18:00, so they say. So I have a printer that doesn't work and I have to wait 2 1/2 days to get support. I will not be buying an HP product again."
93,"I bought a 15.6 notebook on Amazon.com that did not have an operating system installed! I called HP customer service and was on the phone for hours with a few different reps, one of whom did not even know how to send me a text message! They sent me two different flash drives to install the operating system and neither of them worked! Then I sent my computer to them for repair and it got stolen on return by FedEx because FedEx allowed  a total stranger sign for my package! It took another month to get everything in line for a replacement and I had to do the leg work, including filing a police report. The escalation department rep took days to get back to me with very little progress and he could not provide me a timeline about when of if I would receive a replacement computer. It has been over two months since I purchased my faulty computer and I have been getting the runaround ever since. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH HEWLETT PACKARD. Their products are JUNK and their customer service is a slice of hell!"
94,Bought a new laptop- returned it faulty- asked for a replacement- received a 'used' laptop which had some private pictures and mobile numbers stored . How can a company send you a used product when you think you are buying a new product.Despicable-  Breach of Date Protection-
95,Today I went back to HP.com albeit online. I thought that I would give them another try. I requested help from a sales assistant. I was looking for a Windows10 laptop which is not bound by the dreaded Windows S mode that keeps you locked in to Edge and unable to use Google Chrome / Drive etc or Firefox. I was treated with contempt because I was looking for a laptop which offered value for money. The assistant only found one in my price range (£700) and stated that because it was low value I should expect problems. As you could imagine I did not proceed to the checkout. I went to Argos instead. Not even one star HP.com! If you treat your customers with contempt they will go elsewhere. Sales assistants should be enthusiastic about the products. Are the products so bad that even paid employees can not muster any enthusiasm for them?
96,"Second time I bought a Hp Laptop and this time the Omen ,Why did I throw my money away on this crap.I had a Hp Pavillion and swore never to buy hp again and like an idiot I did.Never buy HP Products,don't last and just pack up with little use."
97,I've sat on chat for over an hour now. With someone who refuses to listen to a thing I say and is refusing to actually be of assistance including letting me speak with someone else. They will not close the chat to allow me to do so and everytime I open the chat now it goes to the same person. At this point this is harassment and I will never buy another HP product or recommend it.
98,Hp printers are an absolute nightmare of a printer. Constantly keeps disconnecting from my phone eventhough ive got the app installed 2 or 3 times and connected to the same network. Works good on my computer but not on my phone which is why i bought it in the first place.
99,Worst experience....Gave my new hp laptop regarding mother board issues to skypro service center in chennai...It has been 2 months and still no updates were made from hp center .....I'm seeing many people facing the similar issues with hp laptop...Never ever trust this company
100,"Signed up for ink delivery - started receiving too much ink and hadn’t used all of it so I cancelled service. The ink I already paid for was still in printer, my printer would work and when I called HP they said I would have to buy new ink, I couldn’t use the ink I paid for as I cancelled my subscription. What a scam….  ☹️"
101,Worst brand and worst products a company could provide.  Don't ever purchase anything from this company as it will always scam you in the name of its goodwill. All of its products stop functioning after the guarantee period is over which mainly means to repair again and then again after another year the same problem comes. So lesson of day hp is trash and and never trust this brand
102,My problem is with the reduced amount of ink in an HP cartridge these days. It's clearly daylight robbery but they get away with it because they have you over a barrel. You cannot even refill them so there must be zillions of empty plastic cartridges fouling up the planet.  A complete rip-off!
103,Logged a support call yesterday at 1700 because of print issues. Despite assurances the next agent would respond to me I am still waiting 29 hours later. Abysmal products matched only by their service levels
104,I recently bought a bundle package of a new laptop and printer direct from Hp.The quality on both is absolutely shocking. The laptop is something else graphics are awful and cheap materials make it virtually unusable. Believe me go to a shop first to check out the items As these are not worth the money. And their website helpline is a joke.
105,"4 years ago I purchased a HP Envy laptop from HP for £2000, the cable from the motherboard to the screen had failed. I have just got off the phone to HP and there is nothing they can do as parts for that model has discontinued. So now a perfectly working laptop has to be thrown in the bin, just because of a ribbon cable. Never again will I buy from HP"
106,"Worst customer service EVER!  Agents obfuscate, are unhelpful and overall, rude - and I’m trying to give them my money!!! When one asks for a manager, the response is that they are in US and won’t interact with customers. Buy from HP at your own peril!"
107,"HP insrtant ink and their printers is a SCAM. the call cetre dont ahve aclue what the \Policy is as it changes frpm person to person. You spend £200 plus to own a HP machine. you cancel your HP instank ink, because somtimes in life things happen. then when circumstances are better you enroll again. My subscription was canceled on 2 occasions and HP now refuse to allow me to re enroll this printer. My only option is to purchase a new one! They are in complete control and at the flick of a switch they will render 'your machine' useless. I would be ashamed to work or partner HP. I will never buy any of their products again.This 2 time cancellation policy is not published in their T&Cs. At no point are you given this information to allow you to make the decision if this product & service is right for you.An absolute disgrace of a serviceCASE ID: 5101673981/5102439100"
108,"Extremely poor customer service. I ordered 4 keyboards for my company and when I received them the keyboards were a different product than the one shown on the box. I reached out to HP right away and they only replied ""we use worldwide stock images to display and since you ordered as a Business customer you cannot return the products"".This is false advertising and HP did not take any responsibility for it. They basically kept our money. Unbelievable. I will never ever order from HP again."
109,"Ordered  HP X27 (27"" ) FHD IPS Gaming Monitor. Had 6 notices of delivery delays. Ages to get through to customer service. Finally told monitor not in stock. More expected in 2024!!Supposedly getting a refund. Do I I believe them…?"
110,Only used computer 5 times and it won't work.Just wasted money on a piece of junk
111,I would have given them no stars if an option.  5 people could not tell me what adaptor to use to connect a brand new HP monitor to my MacBook Air.   They all told me essentially to go buy an HP PC.Seriously - wasted 2 hours of my time trying to get the right adaptor model number.  I wanted to buy it from them as I assumed they 1) wanted a sale 2) wanted me to keep their monitor I just purchased  3) love my Macs!One told me there were settings on my Mac that had to be changed.  Nope. That's not true. Another told me to call Apple and ask them. All were at call centers in foreign countries.
112,"The printer HP Envy 4520 has been a real beauty - worked for years with no problems, I have paid many-many times the cost of the printer in original refill ink, which is ok. But it is not ok that to use my scanner I have to log in to the HP-business app. I don't want to log in anywhere when my printer is sitting right next to my desk. Get real!"
113,"I have an extended warranty on my HP Pavilion that I purchased from HP. They were quick to take my money and I have not needed to use it until now.Had issues with keyboard on laptop plus the hinge and logged a case on 24 Jan 23, due for repair completion by 10 Feb 23. This date kept moving every month.Spoke to HP on chat they say that there is a parts shortage and I just need to wait. Finally, got case escalated to a customer representative on 08th March (Francisco R). Was then asked to follow up with proof of purchase. Then was offered a non identical replacement on 20th March which I did not accept. Then was told on 04th April that a suitable replacement was being sourced. On 12th April was sent my old laptop in the post. The hinges were dirty and seemed like the keyboard was replaced however there was a crack in the case. It has now been over 11 weeks, I have my old laptop in a worse state than originally provided to HP and a case representative whom hasn't helped in progressing to a suitable resolution.HP CRT UK & IE 5101519300 CRM:0050277006190Case Number 509899319809 May 23 - This issue is now resolved with HP buying back the laptop. It took approx. 14 weeks to resolve but the resolution is appropriate so I am increasing the stars from 1 to 3."
114,"HP wants CRAZY Toner prices! You can buy the exact same original OEM HP toner, not house brands, on other websites for 30% less. I've tried multiple times, but I think HP just truly doesn't care. They just want to gouge customers that only want to buy from the manufacturer and don't do any homework."
115,"So on the date of experience 3-14-23 I used the virtual assistant after the I found out my hp omen desktop was DOA... the virtual assistant wasn't cutting it as far as needs so I put a request through it to talk to someone the individual on man on tech support did great and listened. so he wired me to see about get it repaired or replaced as I said whichever would would be quicker and the individual did a phenomenal job. She was very nice and very personable and helped me tremendously frankly hp/ omen needs to do everything they can to keep her, because some is great asset to the company as she gave the the company someone felt I could trust to help me as a customer. See I usually had tendency to avoid or dread such needs but on this date I wouldn't mind needing to get help again."
116,Fraud Warning about third party Tech support companies used by HP. I am disappointed to give HP a poor score. I like HP products and always found them reliable and with excellent customer service. I have 5 HP PCs and 4 HP printers. Printers are not as easy to install as they were and I needed to contact tech support installing a new one. I phoned and was told to wait for a call back. I was later called by someone from a company called UKGeeksLtd who told me the issue need them to install software that would cost between £199 and £599. I declined and hung up. I persevered and set up the printer myself. I researched the company and found they have done this to others. I have tried to inform HP that they are directing their customers to third party companies that try and de-fraud them and basically they are not interested.
117,"Does this company have any technical people, Ive been ringing Tech support about a broken printer thats in warranty, eventually they supplied a replacement which was broken, several calls and days later another printer arrived, I moved the consumables across and the new printer is asking for setup cartridges which were supposed to be in the box but were not. 2 months without a printer we now have 3 here and none work. Getting nowhere with tech support they dont seem to be able to think for themselves."
118,"I called because the computer had stopped communicating with the printer.  I was on the phone upwards of an hour as the tech explain why the computer had stopped Printing and why it was unable to be fixed by me. I was told it would take a HP tech to remove all the error codes and install new drivers.  This would cost between $199.00and $399.00.  I declined  then reviewed my options.  I deleted all the printers on the computer, then I ran a registry cleaner (Ccleaner)  . And then went to add a printer and added the printer.  It now works perfectly!!   Admit took less than 10 minutes!!I am undecided if thr HP techs are not fully trained or if calling their support is just a way for them to get more of your money?  I do know that I will not be using or recommending HP again."
119,"Scam take your money and don’t send out the ink. Cancelled my direct debit at the bank and informed HP of my wish to cancel. They then started taking money from my long card number which they insist on getting even though it’s not actually needed for a direct debit. Clearly a scam as they were refused by bank when tried to claim direct debit, so they took the money off my card. Rip off"
120,hp=hate printerhp=hate producthp=Hard as hell to Printcannot get hp laptop to print on hp printer after trying 10 ways for over a yr...gotta save doc to thumb drive from hp laptop and stick thumb drive in hp printer to print and try hard as hell not to cuss unsuccessfully
121,Taskbar content disappeared. Takes ages to open up. Slow as a week in jail.Useless and only 5 years old.Only personal use.No downloads or games.If there was an option for zero  or minus stars I wouldn't have given a one star.
122,"I don't understand why so many people gave HP bad reviews. I have purchased nothing but HP products since the early 1990s. I am a retired IT manager and only let HP products come into the company. During the 18 years I was there, I don't recall a SINGLE problem.I bought a multi function printer for personal use in February of 2017. It was refurbished and as of today, 02.26.23, it still operates like a new printer!I have only needed to contact HP support once and it was a good experience."
123,The technician who came for repair of my laptop stole my laptops webcam and than when I asked the service centre to fix my webcam they were delaying me and kept annoying me and were unable to Provide for technician ..Just hate their products and their service
124,"They'll tell you your instant ink subscription is cancelled online, and then keep charging you. It's criminal."
125,"My laptop broke just 4 months after buying it. It began hard crashing when I picked it up - an obvious hardware fault.I contacted HT customer support. They picked up the laptop from me and ""fixed"" it by reinstalling Windows.That's right - they ""fixed"" a hardware issue by reinstalling the OS. Ridiculous.Obviously this did absolutely nothing to fix my laptop and it continued to crash every time it was picked up.Then when I tried to recontact support they simply ghosted me, and never responded to any of my messages. It's been several months now and still no response.I'm now down €500 with a faulty laptop while the warantee slowly runs out.Avoid, avoid, avoid HP."
126,"Seems I cannot use my HP printer without signing up for an HP account - which I have no need for and do not wish to do. I just want to use my printer! Grrr. This may be user error, but I keep getting errors on the display screen of the printer saying it will not work until I set up an account. I was able to pair the printer with my laptop fine to begin with, but now it won't play ball without an account."
127,"Awful, plain awful, have been charging me for an ink subscription and not actually sending products out. Costumer service is abhorrently bad, good luck trying to get through. The product are also not worth the money."
128,"I ordered an HP OfficeJet Pro 8025e All-in-One printer from Fingerhut. The printer was delivered on March 1 - as I took it out of the box, I noticed that two of the four ink cartridges were damaged - rendering this printer USELESS. Speaking of uselessness, I called HP Support who blamed Fingerhut and threw it back to them - that is BS because the printer is under HP warranty for ONE YEAR. Now Fingerhut tells me I have to return it - this is the very last thing I wanted to do - this is not the first time I've had problems with HP - I VOW never, ever to consider an HP purchase - their products are expensive garbage and HP SUPPORT is an oxymoron!"
129,"Bought a printer a few months ago with the offer of 3 months of free Instant Ink - when I run out of ink and was about to subscribe for the ink service, I was told that the free 3 months weren't redeemable any longer, as the service should have been activated 7 days after the set up!! The information was very well hidden on the website and at no point of the set up I was told that my offer would have expired soon - nor I received any reminder via email. The customer service was useless, they didn't offer any other kind of compensation, nor tried to make it up for it in any way - they also didn't want to give me any email to make an official complaint! And also - on another note - we had to call 6 times to link the printer to the Instant Ink account!!! 6 times!! I'm utterly disappointed"
130,"BEWARE!  HP 9015e printer took 4 hours, with an HP tech helping, just get up and running.  Horrible product!  Im done with HP!!"
131,Deliberately installing software to block refurbished or 3rd party toner cartridges is extortion.Why are you still doing this despite losing court cases and being fined by regulators? Your toner is exorbitantly expensiveDo not buy anything from these criminals
132,"You do not know how to fix anything. 3+ hours 9n phone for printer issue. You blame on my laptop, also HP. You tell me I have to pay for repairs that you cannot even diagnose. Never buying any of your garbage again. Useless...."
133,"Needed to send my laptop for repair. After all the customary exchange of info, was told by call center that they will send me a quotation via email for the repair cost (end of business day or latest within 24 hours)It’s coming to 2 days and still no response. Called the call center again… usual reply that they will check.In fact this is not my first request for support from HP. Previous request for assistance became a maze of red tapes and frustration.I will not buy any product from this brand again."
134,I bought an HP Pavilion laptop last September and have had a lot of trouble getting it to connect to the internet. My local computer repair shop have re-installed software but it just works for a couple of days.  No point in getting in touch with HP. Even if your laptop is under warranty they won't help you unless you sign up to one of their plans at £10 a month. This is a company that only wants to extract money from you so avoid their products.
135,Why does this company still exists? Their tech is from the 90s standard at everything they do. nuke this company tot the ground. harvest the employees organs is more useful
136,"Everything. Literally everything that could go badly, did go badly, catastrophically and completely. My original HP care pack was debited 3x from my account, and for some reason none of the payments cleared, and the $ was returned, cancelling my monthly subscription to my Care Pack. (And YES, it's a Care Pack, not that Smart Friend BS). All I wanted to do was renew my subscription but, after logging into my account and looking at previous subscriptions, was dismayed to find there was no link available to it. HP technically has *two* separate websites that you can purchase Care Packs from, and it's super freaking confusing trying to find the one that you need AND one that's appropriate for your device (in my case, HP ENVY x360 w/AMD Ryzen 7 processor). In any case, after hours of searching I couldn't find the Care Pack I had purchased previously, so I decided to try chatting w/ HP Customer Support.It was a living freaking nightmare, as usual. After well over an hour of, in many cases, blatantly wrong answers and unnecessary questioning, I ended up just giving up--and, hilariously, their ""final answer"" was more wrong than any other they had given me up until that point!  Some examples taken from the text:1. Yes, there is only one care pack available for your device. It's a 3-year HP care pack for $135.00 (there are actually about 5 or 6--this is the most expensive option)2. Can you give me the original order number from your HP Care Pack? (I did 3 times) ....it's not showing up on my end, it just shows up in all asterisks. (Yes--because it's a private customer order number!! You can't view it! How do you not know this? Why can't you just look up subscriptions on my account???)3. Where did you purchase your HP Laptop from? You should have purchased the HP Care Pack at the time of your laptop purchase. You might not be able to do so, since your laptop has been active more than 90 days (THIS IS BLATANTLY WRONG. And it was Amazon--they don't have an option to purchase a care pack from the HP store when you buy a laptop on there smfh. Not only that--but the warranty FFS)4. I've found your monthly subscription and included the link. You had purchased a monthly subscription to HP Smart Friend, not a Care Pack (again BLATANTLY WRONG, as I explained to him in the beginning, no, it was an HP Care Pack, not a Smart Friend subscription. Had he even simply looked at my account & my previous subscriptions, it literally said in black and white HP Care Pack w/ ADP & REPAIR)HP customer service is WORSE than useless. They frequently say they are ""consulting their team"" when it is obvious that all they are doing is skimming the already-available commercial resources on the normal HP website. You will never get direct answers to simple questions, are often met with blatant incompetence, if not outright lies or misleading information, they will constantly try and sell you things not even appropriate for your device, ask you totally irrelevant questions....the list goes on, but in short, it is truly ASTOUNDINGLY MIND-BOGGLING how UTTERLY USELESS & INCOMPETENT HP Customer Service personnel are. You are INFINITELY better off avoiding them entirely, and seeking answers on community forums instead. Trust me, if you weren't angry before you called them, you will *definitely* be angry by the time you hang up.TO MIKE GEE: I have an HP ENVY x360 that currently has an identical problem, and has had the same problem in the past. Usually the first thing that fails is the touchscreen, and before you know it, your HP will get stuck on the load screen FOREVER. While I don't have the UK Customer Service number, I can tell you it's a hardware issue--you need to send your HP in for repair. They'll offer you a Windows recovery USB stick, but you can't reach the recovery screen either. HERE IS MY WORKAROUND TO FORCE YOUR HP TO LOAD (it's a little strange, but it works)There are two possible methods. Use whichever works. 1. Turn on your HP. The MOMENT the screen activates but BEFORE the HP load logo is displayed, SHUT THE LID OF THE LAPTOP, and wait about 5 mins. When you open it, you should be at your home screen. 2. Turn on the HP, and immediately shut the lid BEFORE the screen kicks on. Wait 5 mins. If you open it and it says it's ""preparing automatic repair"", press & hold the power button to turn off, and try again. If met with a completely black screen, also press & hold power button, then turn off. Afterward, follow method 1. I have no clue why this seems to work, but it's worked for me both times that I've had the same problem you have. The problem is the integrated processor. It overheats & corrupts very easily, bc the cooling fans are awful. I hope this helps!"
137,"STAY AWAY FROM HP, the worst printers out there, constant connection issues, customer service is shocking, reluctant to exchange for a new one after only having it for 3 months, so bad! STAY AWAY."

139,"I would give them a big ol fat Ass ZERO, but lowest is one star. I bought an Envy 6400 series and was duped into enrolling in their instant ink program. I didn't see an option actually as I couldn't set up the printer otherwise. In fact I actually needed the stupid app to complete set up on my printer. Well. Trial subscription ran out and now I'm left without a working printer. The ink cartridges that came with it won't even work as one had to stay enrolled in the program. So I have to buy non sanctioned HP cartridges in order for it to work. So here I sit after 45 min with online chat ""help"" and currently on a 45 min wait still for a live person! Customer support is a joke. Never ever ever again will I buy an HP piece of JUNK!!!! Buyer beware."
140,Stay away from HPI have owned this piece of scrape for 2 years. Not once have I been able to turn in on and it would just work. Now after around 50 pages printed it broke down completely. I dont even give it to fix. It is just a piece of junk and I thoroughly hope that is company will go bankrupt.
141,"Laptop has been sent back for repair twice, still not fixed. I've called back again with the same issue to say it has been fixed. You can't speak to a manager/supervisor. You can't make a complaint because they have no contact details and they just laugh at you on the phone. Customer service is absolutely shocking."
142,"They sold me a printer at full price in 2021 that they knew would never get another software update, as it was released in 2016. I bought this at full price, unaware they were moving to a new model, as there was no way to discern this on their site. The printer never worked well at all, constantly misfiring, misaligning no matter how many resets it got. This was a $250 printer, mind you. It finally broke altogether yesterday, and their customer support informed me that there was nothing to be done at all, and the only option was to buy a brand new printer at full price. Absolutely shameful experience. Nobody wants to buy a new piece of hardware at full price every two years because a lazy company is unwilling to invest in minor software updates for older equipment. This shows no respect for your customers."
143,"HP Instant Ink is a great idea and cheap. But my God, the customer service is appalling and you have to jump through hoops. Replaced an ink cartridge with one sent 4 months ago and seems to be dried up. Contacted them to ask if my black ink can be sent earlier (due to be shipped in 1 week) and they require photos of the cartridge nozzle, to shake it, replace it and then to follow 10-15 steps to then see if it is faulty because apparently the printer not printing black ink isn't proof enough. It's the same ink that would be sent in ONE SINGLE WEEK that they refuse to send out until you complete all these steps to prove the ink is empty or dried up. Like really? Just send out the ink that's going to be sent out? You have to go through a virtual agent first to even go to a live agent, which then told me I needed to open a case when it told me to contact the Whatsapp to begin with to go back to the site to open the case for me not to need a case? It's just a lot of hardwork to get working ink and the printers are just okay anyway."
144,"Printer constantly goes “off-line” when all other gadgets are still connected. Frequently, I have to de-install the printer and reinstall it to get it back. I’ve never had such a temperamental piece of home office ware. Would absolutely never recommend."
145,"Just purchased a new HP printer. Followed the setup instructions to the letter. Printer would not print. After spending a couple of hours on it with no luck contacted customer support. I was informed that the reason my printer would not print was due to the fact that I had a trojan (malware) and that removing it would solve all of my problems. Cost was $199 Agreed to the removal. Here's the thing...I did not see the customer service tech remove any malware. He immediately started to install and re-install printer software. All in all I spent 9 hours of my life (that I will never get back) with 4 different techs before the printer finally worked. Then the tech tried (pushed) to sell me a $1500 network firewall.I have to say that I feel like I've been scammed and will never buy another HP product...period. I would rate my experience at less than a ""1"" if possible."
146,"I bought a HP All-In-One computer and a HP printer, I have tried to get it to print to no avail, a tech engineer from HP spent 2 hours trying to get it and failed, then stating that Windows was at fault. The irony being I have to now use my old Toshiba laptop running the same version of windows as a print server. I would have thought you would have configured your firmware to work with your own printers, if you had to pay me for the amount of time I have wasted it would be racked up in the £1000s, not to mention the time spent by your tech support engineers trying to get the devices talking to each other. I also discovered that I could not replace the HDD with an SSD due to some firmware problem and it will not cast output to another display again another reason my old Toshiba is still around. Additionally, it fails to clip back together properly, it is a really bad design from a construction stand point."
147,"Worst customer service experience ever, they got my name wrong and diverted me to A.I numerous times, after waiting and getting to somebody they put the phone down on me.This is because the laptop they gave me was faulty and had a blue screen of death upon 2nd use. DO NOT BUY"
148,"Unbelievably bad. Been in a WhatsApp support chat for 5 days and to say they are awful is an understatement.For a company I thought was good, not anymore. Terrible."
149,"The false advertising bit - I bought an HP laptop 5 days ago.  It is advertised and sold as having PC3200 RAM - but in reality it runs slower as PC2660 and there is no way to change that.Terrible customer service - at first I was pointed at the virtual assistant, what a waste of electrons - none of these bots are that good but the HP effort is particularly useless.Next it tried to get me to pay to speak to someone just to discuss a fault with a laptop bought 5 days ago.Eventually I tried the WhatsApp - I raised a case and was told I would have to wait about 7 minutes.  That was at 13:21.  I waited by my phone for an hour but nothing.  I then had to go into a work meeting and when I got out I got an email that they had closed my case.Basically it had taken them 1 hour and 25 minutes to get back to me (far from the indicated 7 minutes).  They waited an hour but by that time I was in a meeting.  They then concluded that I wasn't available so closed my case.Absolutely shocking way to do customer support.It is probably something minor that they could have resolved easily but because they aren't interested I guess I shall have to return the laptop to the store for refund."
150,"There was a time when HP products were excellent. I know because I have a fully working small B&W laser printer in my home office that is still working perfectly after many years of daily use. However, I also have an all-in one OfficeJet Pro 8620 colour printer, bought a few years ago. It has now failed, and the only on-screen suggestions are  to remove and then replace the mains cable, or reboot the machine, failing which you should ""contact HP"" The former did nothing, and the latter is the way to spend hours of frustration with no satisfactory outcome. For example, it starts by requesting the fault code ""shown on screen"", but there is no code shown, and it gets worse with a chatbot offering irrelevant suggestions. The 90% of reviews on this site that are 1-star tell the sad story of a once great computer company now selling machines that work well for a short time, but when they fail offer a very poor  service to get them going again. Alternatively, you can pay £21 to talk to a technician, which is refundable only if they cannot solve the problem, and you accept HP's quote for a repair. Added to this are the frequent complaints  about the high cost of ink, that I fully endorse."
151,"A nasty, monopolizing company that values profit over customers. It's no wonder they boast a 1-star rating with thousands & thousands of reviews! 🤢🤮First, HP auto-updated my printer (and probably yours, too!) to REJECT off-brand, generic toners. This effectively forces us to buy HP's overpriced toners—for me, this is $446 plus tax every time I need to buy all 4 colors. Unless you want to foot the bill of a brand-new printer every time you need some ink, I suggest you stay far, far away from HP.Secondly, I've had recurring connectivity issues with my $450 LaserJet printer and no way to access a real person for customer service UNLESS—get this—I pay $99 or more to talk to someone. Frustrated after hours of troubleshooting, I paid and have yet to receive an email with instructions to use the service I paid for. Of course, their website and ""virtual assistant"" is of absolutely no help. 👎🏻👎🏽👎🏿More often than not, I find myself printing documents at Fedex because my unreliable printer only works a fraction of the time. Pretty sad considering I have a *very* lightly-used HP printer collecting dust in my office!"
152,Never buy HP Products as the models get old even if in working condition they do not provide service and cartridge / toners are always OUT OF STOCK
153,"waiting since last 1 hour to chat with an agent in a moment. new laptop, weird problems. never buying hp again"
154,My laptop is not charging at all within 9 months of purchase and when I sent laptop back. They are telling I damaged the laptop and repair cost is $ 233 and not covered by warranty. But it's battery issue. Never buy any HP products. Waste of money on the long run.
155,"case  5101193058. some rep who clearly was not an IT person, asked me a bunch of questions including did i restart...???  he wasted over 15mins of my time just to direct me to another group.  i purchased my laptop 3 months ago.  the first group he gives me a ph# to is FEE BASED.  i said wth would i have to call to a fee based group who is not HP.  after i asked that then he provided me a secondary number to a free group.  HORRIBLE!  will never purchase another HP in my life."
156,I have multiple printers for my company where the original toners are way to overpriced. Printer is good but the price of the toner…
157,"When I was downloading a game, it says low storage. I deleted stuff to free up space, but it still says low storage. Please improve or else I will think about having to sue you."
158,"Their support system is specifically difficult to get through - the people themselves are helpful but getting to them is difficult. I used the call back option and was never phoned, I spoke to them on WhatsApp and it took a week to assign me someone to speak to. When I got through on WhatsApp they referred me to another team with a phone number that tried to redirect me back to WhatsApp. The painful thing is that I found out my purchase won't work and I need a refund - but the refund period is a ridiculously short 2 weeks. I spent those 2 weeks being passed from team to team and not actually speaking to anyone, so once I'd found out a refund would be necessary it was too late. Absolutely aggravated and dissapointed by both the contact options and efficiency, but mostly the short refund period and inflexibility when it came to issues caused by hp themselves. Seems perfectly designed so that hp never have to give out a refund."
159,"So so inadequate in numerous areas… Misleading in their technical advice for stylus replacement, send the wrong thing. Hard to communicate with them too as they are so incompetent and disorganised. Hp never ever again!!"
160,"The worst printer ever, and way to expensive with ink.Completely lock products that forced you to use abnormally amounts of money on inck.My first and last hp product."
161,"Horrible laptops, the mouse has stopped working and it's only been 2 months since I purchased it. Plus the customer support is nonexistent."

163,"Okay, I want everyone to understand that I'm not the type of person to put down or disgrace a company or individual on social media or anywhere for that matter. However, I am so frustrated with Hewlett-Packard.  I have gone around and around with their customer service over a laptop that THEY ""repaired"" for me that upon receipt and unpacking of my ""professionally repaired"" laptop I noticed a big crack across the screen that I know for a fact wasn't there when I sent it to them. After contacting customer service, via their online chat service which is the best way according to  #hewlett-packard #hp  recommends is to get any situation handled in a timely matter, I have now opened 4 cases with them about this and have yet to receive a phone call from the case manager. I was  promised, everytime, to get this call to  inform me if and when they will rectify my situation. All the customer service rep would tell me is that the cracked screen wasn't covered under my warranty. Well, since they cracked it I don't give a flip about the warranty covering it I just want them to fix it! This has greatly affected my life! I was taking online college courses and have been forced to drop out and have lost a lot of money while depending on something that would be handled in a week or two now dragging out for over a month. I will never purchase another product from nor recommend @hewllet-packard #hewlett-packard #hp and it's all because of their poor customer service."
164,Stay away from subscription with HP .They charge the earth if you go over your amount !!!!Very difficult to get out off and then they charge you a fee !Plus when you do cancel they charge you again . Even though you have paid for the cartridges they will not let you use them once you cancel.This company are very distrustful.Buy your own cartridges or end up with the taking over 40:00 per month.
165,Crazy asf why this still exist I’m not needing any of it too bad for me 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
166,"I ordered a premium high end All In One computer. The website describes that computer comes with a ""Black"" Model HP 915 keyboard and mouse. Whist the keyboard is high quality it is metallic grey and the letters are not clear for my eye sight. I specifically went for this package due to the description on the website. After contacting the complaints team, I have been offered a basic budget range keyboard replacement which is not like for like to HP915. I believe that the closest black keyboard available to my current is HP 970, but also requested that the company offers a similar spec in black. I would like to reach an amicable resolution which is fair and just. I reiterate that the facts are:• The website description (evidence such as screen print available) was and still continues to be misleading, describing something as a black keyboard inaccurately• I selected a premier product in the HP range. I could have gone for even a sub 1k machine, but that was not the case. The machine I purchased was approx. £2k.• The keyboard offered (HP260) as a good will gesture is materially below the standard of the keyboard that I am seeking to replaceFor honest practical reasons, I can not simply return the whole system back, as I have invested approximately 2/3 days in setting this machine, buying single user licences and a lot of effort in migrating the data over.This meant that I have already incurred expenses in getting the computer set up and bought licences for relevant software. I am 61 years old and I was specific in buying a computer that came with a black keyboard for ease of use. It is not an option to return the whole package for the reasons mentioned.Having looked at their website, the closest match is HP975."
167,"I pay for ink every month that I never receive and their customer support number is permanantly ""temporarily unavailable"". Crooks!"
168,"Do not buy a HP laptop. Sent for repair 3 times come back with the same fault, they must be blind. Customer service are cheeky and horrid. Had my laptop for over 2 weeks last time they were repairing it, been away for over a month in total. DO NOT BUY ANY HP PRODUCTS!!!!!! Instant ink just as bad."
169,"We recently had to replace our HP printer due to a broken printer head. We opted for a new printer that came with a free 6-month ink subscription. However, we were unpleasantly surprised to find that the new printer was blocked from printing by HP, as our old printer still had an active subscription, even though it was no longer in use.Upon investigating the matter further, we discovered that the subscription was not just for ink, but also for the rent to allow pages to be printed. This meant that we had to pay for the subscription on the old printer in order to use our new printer, or risk having it blocked by HP.While the concept of a subscription model for printers is not new, we were not adequately informed of the details when we purchased our original printer. It is important for HP to be more transparent about the terms of their subscription model, particularly as it relates to the rent for printing pages and blocking printing ability if subscription is not paid.It is important for consumers to be aware of the subscription model for HP printers and the associated rental fee for printing pages. While the idea of a subscription model can be convenient for some, it is important to fully understand the terms and conditions before making a purchase to avoid any unpleasant surprises down the line like what we received."
170,My HP Envy printer is just horrendous. It rarely works. It never connects. It is very slow. It can never be found by various computers. When you need it it fails. Every time. I want to throw it at the wall but I doubt that will help.
171,"When I ordered the HP laptop (approx. 1/17/2021), took one hour, I did not realize I was talking to someone in the Phillipians and he said the laptop was made in China, but parts from all over, so he said. Laptop was promised by 2/01/2023. It got stuck in customs and I asked to return it. I could not because it was customized. I finally got it 2/13/23. It would not start. Called tech support to get it working. Two days later it didn't start up again. Spent way over an hour. In between that, the ""customized order"" of backlights, did not work, and the fingerprint takes several times to work. Never really used it beyond that because of the issues.Next day, nothing. Said wrong password and fingerpringt did not work. I had to do a factory reset. Which takes forever. Each time I asked to return it because I paid almost $1000 for a laptop for this. I calculated, for their restocking at $950 that's $142.50, then Florida state taxes $57, totalling $179.95Very difficult to be speaking to Tech's from India. Usually very courteous, but lengthy sentences that I don't understand half their dialect, resulting in questions not appropriately answered and often deflecting my question.This was my fourth bad laptop, but the other three companies had no issue with me returning. First was an HP, duh, why order another? Second, no secure packing and another reason, sent it right back, third was the wrong laptop, they had no issues."
172,"Order a computer, giving a shipping day two weeks later, then a day after its suppose to ship they email me they need two more weeks. They are selling what they don't have. Thieves"
173,"I contacted HP  about my HP Pavilion touchscreen cage coming apart. My laptop was collected by the courier and a few days later, I saw on my case tracker that I should contact HP. I called and they were telling me that engineers have refused to repair your unit because they had detected liquid and accidental damage in your machine. I was shocked and disgusted. I challenged them for hours and days and the only solutions they offered were either to return the laptop unrepaired or buy replacement parts (like screen, motherboard, etc) from them. When I asked how much it was going to cost, they quoted £441. This is a unit I purchased from HP with a warranty for £471 - the warranty is still running. At that point, I knew they wanted to rob me by forcing me to get another laptop from them. I refused to pay for any replacement parts. I told them it's like taking your car to the mechanics to get the side mirror fixed and they demand you buy a new engine, exhaust, etc before they will repair the side mirror. They returned the unrepaired unit to me and surprisingly, it came with missing screws. I called HP and they denied it had happened at their end (because they had classified the laptop as accidental damage) and asked me for evidence that the screws were in place when they collected the unit from me. I then asked them to provide me with evidence that the screws were not in place when they received the laptop. They then sent me a discount voucher to get a new laptop or screen changed. I was at this point more convinced HP knew they were wrong and wanted to use this as compensation. I told them I would never use this voucher because none of the things in your report is true. I have contacted the Citizens Advice Bureau about this issue. HP are big-time liars and cheats who prey on their customers. Please avoid them at all costs!!!"
174,"Absolute garbage, bought from best buy and takes hours to load a web page. Not gonna waste my time here explaining. But have to say, be carefull."
175,"I have heard some Bulls**t in my time, this goes straight to No.: 1 of my 100 Bulls**ter’s.  My HP laptop crashed for which I needed to have my Windows 10 OS re-installed via File sent from HP.  It transpired that because USB port was not being displayed in the recovery process on my Laptop I would need them to send me the file again, BUT!!!!!The file we be sent again to friends PC. HP would then dial into my friends PC and make changes to the file for me to upload in my external hard drive.  This is where I started to think “Rogue” “Con” “Hackers”The HP Technician would then access my external HD on my crashed laptop but would need to erase all the other data on my external HD as it could corrupt the HP file he/she is accessing to get Windows 10 OS reinstalled.For those in HP employment who don’t know why people around the world use external HD’s I’ll explain.  My main documents, files, photos etc, etc are on my external HD with a backup in cloud storage.When I asked can you not make the changes to the file your end and then send file to my friends PC, I was told no there is no other way HP could do this.My case number is 5101388142I hope someone up the pay scale on HP’s Board of Directors gets to read this, I’m sure your Under Writer’s will for this is the, biggest breach of data compliance & confidentially I have laid witness to.I’d like to see how HP Board explains this to the press!!, for me it truly was a One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest experience.I’m going back to ACER, should never have left.This link sends you around in circles between HP & Microsoft.  A total waste of time.HP Support: Paul Tikkanen “Expert” gives me link to Microsoft to download Tool, Microsoft route me back to download Tool, HP redirects me back to Microsoft - Get The Picture!!!!!!"
176,"I thought that I was being over the top with my HP printer experience but I see it's not just me.  If I could give them a -0- I would.   I'm not sure when their products and customer service turned into garbage.  I am planning on filing a formal federal complaint  with the SEC.  I know the books have to be cooked.  I was told by one of their spt people that they intentionally stopped supporting the HP Color Laser Jet  Pro MFP  M177fw.      My printer is indeed several years old, however it's not a printer that gets heavy usage (I used it more for scanning and the occasional color print)   I received the screen of death with is the HP logo and the Energy Star Logo.    HP remoted into the printer, had me do a few things which resulted in the WIFI being deleted.  I can use the printer to print and I have to manually scan (no  option to use the feeder) and because I have no menu at all, I cannot make copies and I cannot change out the toner.Talking to HP is like talking to a 6 month old child that can't speak the language, and just smiles and laughs at you .  I reached out to HP on Twitter and that was an epic failure.  I'm  not kidding when I say they asked me for the same info no less than 10 times.  I felt like someone was sitting behind a desk laughing at me.    I'm just waiting on my printer to finally give out and die a painful death.I also have an HP 4155e which you could not install unless you opted into some HP BS.    I thought we went to federal court with Microsoft back in the day over similar requirements.    If you don't opt-in, then guess what, your printer does not work.   The OLD HP was great... this new HP company is filled with nothing but garbage.  I am thankful that my current HP touchscreen computer has not given me any issues.  I will keep my fingers crossed."
177,"I'm extremely furious with how bad customer service has been with helping with repairs, i've been an HP customer for over 20 years, over 400 PCs/laptops purchased and never had this bad of customer service in my life. I started a case over 4 month ago and it's been nothing but back and forth emails troubleshooting the PC to figure out why it's overheating. They end up sending someone to my house which stated very clearly that the PC is overheating and needs a new case. It was a known issue for the 30L OMEN specially with ones with 3080/3090. the PC gets so loud when i'm trying to record videos and i just can't record anything of quality due to how loud it gets, only way i can use it is when i open up the case with a fan blowing on it so it can keep cool. They end up calling me to tell me they don't believe the tech they THEY SENT is right and want to look at it. Remember THEY sent the tech guy to my house, this isn't someone i brought here to look at it. I ended up sending the desktop to HP for another test, the tech called me to tell me that yes your PC is running really hot and that's with no applications on it. I then get an email when the tech guy told me somone would call me. the email just stated that the desktop will be returned to me because no issue was found on the PC. The PC was then packaged and shipped back to me without anyone talking to me or trying to resolve the issue. The issue remains, the PC runs extremely hot and isn't usable. i really need someone of high level to step in and help with this else i'm done using this company and this terrible customer service i've had. both techs told me this is a KNOWN ISSUE with 30Ls and hp was not able to fix this under their warranty.  i'm done with this company and will make sure everyone of my over 11.4M business followers learn more about hp and how they treat their customers."

179,"They told me that they couldn't help me , call back tomorrow. The next day they said the system has been down and they don't know when it will work....I said then why did you ask me to call the next day ... Useless."
180,"They make great computers! I have a HP computer that is over 10 Years old, and it still works! I also highly recommend their printer Hp envy 5547."
181,"I wish I never buyed anything from HP. Printers are just BS, they have a lot of errors. When you need it it will break and waste your time, money and nerves. Never again!"
182,"Sent me a faulty item but would not replace it, even if I had purchased the care pack!! Would give zero stars if I could!! Spoke to over 15 agents and none of them could resolve the issue!!!"
183,"The product itself, in this case an All-in-One desktop computer, is fine. I've only had it a short time and previously had one as well. My issue is the SERVICE given by the company. ""Fine"" can be purchased from many companies, and in the future I will be purchasing from another one NOT HP, but the fact that from the moment I ordered it on their website I had issues is the reason for my rating and my complaint. I paid additional to receive the order in 2-3 business days. I had an invoice stating the anticipated date of arrivial(3 business days later). Yet when I'd only gotten notice of the shipment ON the 3rd business day, with expected delivery 4 days later, I attempted to reach out to their Customer Service Dept. This is basically non-existant. With the automated system you cannot get through to CS to begin with. When I finally decided to select ""sales"", knowing I would get a real person that time and hoping to be transferred to CS, I was given a song and dance about why I didn't have my order, asked if I wanted to purchase an EXTENDED WARRANTY on item I didn't even have yet, and then disconnected after asking to be transferred to CS I gave up calling. I emailed next, followed by a reply telling me that my 3-5 day shipping ""STARTS"" after it is first shipped. REALLY?? Because that's not what my invoice said. I replied to that saying as much - and she gave me the same(WRONG) response. I replied again, got someone else who attempted to tell me the same and then I noticed I was refunded my expedited shipping payment. No apology. Just a refund. Keep in mind I now had to be sure I was home for delivery days after I planned to be home. I was told incorrect information and never actually reached a person in service to SPEAK with. This is not a company I ever plan on doing business with again and have told anyone thinking of purchasing a computer NOT to use HP. I can get ""fine"" from Dell or any other company. I have no reason to use HP again."
184,10000% Markup on ink and toner.That's it. That's the whole reason. Worthless company.
185,Trash. Printer is the most rage inducing thing I've ever used and HP Instant Ink feels like a scam
186,"Their printers are rubbish, impossible to set up.If I could leave minus stars I would."
187,Customer service that doesn't even know their own policy.
188,I have contacted HP about this manufacturer issue by email which they dont provide when you click on the correct issue for email link it takes you to a bad link I could find no phone number that would help and only way was through their social media on facebook at first which was a bot that just kept repeating and asking for same information than twitter where I talked to 3 different people and than they all disappeared and than another person came on and wanted again to start from scratch it was a bot message I am recovering from one surgery and preparing for another on the 17th and besides the stress adding extra pain I cant afford and all the hours I have spent I have been sick also I have way too much to do between now and than they are like talking to a revolving door. I am going to copy and paste my complaint in supporting document ith some pictures that they about 5 of the HP people have.  wrote      I have always been happy with HP and have owned quite a few HP and Dell laptops and been pretty happy for the most part. I actually am a computer tech and I recommend Dell and HP to customers. However this last laptop model HP 15-dw0083wm I bought for one for my mom and one for me has been the worst one I’ve owned but I haven’t complained I just kept fixing the bugs and kept cleaning the drives and space and just more maintenance and stuff than any other laptop before and more restores.  Still I know how to do all that fortunately so nothing I would write in and complain about cuz of my overall experience and past experience with HP. However what I do have a complaint about and is unacceptable is not just my moms but now mine too so it isn’t coincidence it’s poorly put together her screen cover cracked about a year ago and I was gonna just take it off fix it but the one screen hinge on side of screen was sticking out u couldn’t get it to stay in without taking the whole laptop apart and mom said she taped it and it was fine which she shouldn’t have had to do and I just seen it and the whole hinge where it screws and side have uplifted now and in the meantime my screen guard cracked in same place which no biggie didn’t affect opening and closing laptop but than last night I went to open laptop and the top started too open and part of it didn’t just like when I get a broken screen replacement with broken hinges. So I used my hands and my heart dropped and carefully opened it praying that the way the hinge was setting above the plastic that it didn’t crack screen. Surprisingly it didn’t but I can’t open and close my laptop normally now the screen is gonna crack. I have never owned a laptop that did this I still have my old HPs and laptops and none have ever done this and both of these I bought same model from Walmart. I didn’t say anything when just moms but when both that isn’t coincidence. And I know this isn’t HP normal quality because I buy mostly HP and Dell and refer most my customers when they are getting new laptops to those and I bought 3 HP laptops for customers this year cuz they had me find them what I thought was the best for what they needed and quality. And I have many of HP very much older and if this was the quality of just of opening and closing having the only 2 of this model I bought I would’ve never bought again but it’s not so I know this was manufacturer and I know sometimes it’s a batch of them like I said they were bought both same time both at walmart but it’s poor quality And I could understand if it was a hard drive or the backlight on screen went or keyboard started getting jumpy or sticking   Or battery or power cord all that stuff is stuff that is normal that eventually goes or would be acceptable but this is not something I have ever seen happen and should not happen the screws from hinge come right out and detach and first the plastic cracks a few days before that’s how it happened in both ours and same exact place. If it wasn’t same exact laptop same exact defect in same exact spot it might be different. And neither of us have kids at home or anyone else in fact so it’s just us using our laptops and handling them
189,Don't even know if there's a point to leave these messages after seeing how many bad reviews they are HP used to be a stand-up company always did whatever they could to make you happy now they don't give a rat's ass it's unbelievable they gave me a quote for an 1800 repair and then dropped it to a thousand like that just to see if I'd pull the trigger what does that tell you anyway hpx2g4 total nightmare
190,"Purchased a HP Notebook at an Argos store. This was to use for general typing in documents only. I had 2 hours to kill most days when doing my teacher training at a college and this was nice and light. I tried using it in the first 3 months Feb to April but it wouldn’t run properly in Windows 10 - which it came with. I could not find the receipt so Argos would not help me when I visited their superstore during the summer hols. Eventually, I gave up thinking it was my Sky Wi-Fi which had had problems also.With the laptop owned around 18 months, I went back to the same store and spoke to a manager quoting this 6 year time scale for good to be of a certain quality, they refused to assist, refused to look at the laptop and advised I deal with HP directly saying it wasn’t anything to do with them:I contacted HP to discuss why I couldn’t use my laptop and they were off no help as I hadn’t purchased any extended warranty. They did, however, talk me through removing files that had been pre-loaded prior to sale. I was concerned at how many they were asking me to delete completely, given that I expected them to be there for a purpose. Moreover, I did not believe this item was faulty, it just wouldn’t function at all - and I was baffled by this. At this point I believed I had been sold something that had an issue but no idea what it may be.Thinking it was fit for the bin I stored it in a cupboard and forgot all about it.I was then advised by a neighbour to use a local It man to sort out both my laptops. My Sony Vaio which John Lewis stated was not repairable as the part was no longer available and my HP. I also had the diagnostics for the Sony and based on all the info I supplied, he estimated a cost of £140. After having the HP laptop for a little while he contacted me and explained the problem with it. Apparently, this problem is down to HP and how it was designed and made. The laptop came with 2GB 32GB. This was not my mistake. He advised that Windows 10 needs a fair amount of storage to run its Microsoft updates. With the laptop and all its functions it comes preloaded with, it was leaving just under 3gb for the laptop to function. I had no files in temporary and had never used the C:/ drive as all my assignments and dissertation were in USB sticks.The laptop could not function until I had run the updates required for the software to operate. However, that was impossible as there was no available space to use? so I was stuck.This IT man who was reviewing my laptop could see when I had used the laptop - 5-6 times in total - what a shambles. I finished a Masters being at the Library until closing every night as a result. He suggested I buy more memory so that I could run updates. Wonderful, I replied and gave him the go ahead. Despite memory being added to the laptop, the updates won’t run now and the memory is not being acknowledged by the laptop. Disappointed with Argos as I expected better support from them for a substandard product that should NEVER have been on the market and NEVER sold by Argos.I am disgusted with HP, and not impressed, given that I had had a spinal surgery and was still recuperating and totally relying on this laptop. Being without a working laptop meant my evenings could not be used to write up assignments etc.No-one offered me anyone any help under their company warranty; even to exchange it. I will never buy a HP product again, having purchased HP printers for the last 24 years. A refund for its original price of £279.99 would be ideal (it was on offer at £249.99 at the time) plus £20 for extra memory, so £300. Perhaps the respective companies need to do an overhaul on their customer service policies and training on products as all this hassle could have been avoided.Training is needed at HP when dealing with issues that are not script related. Moreover, surely the HP design engineers should have picked this up. How long are customers supposed to use a laptop before upgrading? Alternatively, a decision maker (manager/supervisor) should be available every working day they deal with phone queries."
191,"I have spent a great deal of time attempting to obtain help regarding my HP laptop (an error message), which is still under warranty, but having gone through the detailed procedure to obtain advice I receive the message that the facility is not available at the moment, and that I must try again later."
192,"Hp most crap laptops, mines stop working twice in one year , save your money!"
193,amateurs with eyes only for money
194,total waste of time let me with no printer
195,Support is worst. support help deck system is not user / customer friendly
196,"Just looked at some ratings! MY experience is - I have had an HP printer for a lot of years, never had any problems and HP ink service has never let me down although I was very active a few years ago I computed every day, now retired (a number of years) but needed to replace my old device.Just purchased a new computer after searching some comparisons on many manufacturers offers for what I need, found the HP All in One on the HP website Delighted with my choice of HP24 All in One. Highly recommend!"
197,"Absolutely atrociously designed software that makes doing even the most basic task into a ridiculous complexity as they refuse to allow you to use the product you have bought (in my case a printer/scanner) without allowing them to harvest data from you. It is utterly asinine to sign in and create an account with HP that I am not going to use for anything in order to scan a document on my home network. Somehow, despite the vast leaps in technology that have occurred, HP has made their user experience more convoluted, slow and error prone than it was in 1995. Absolutely unbelievable and utterly infuriating."
198,"their cartridges do NOT have a 'use-by' date on them. There is a date but it could be anything, not a use-by.  I bought ten cartridges then went overseas and in the meantime although the cartridges are exactly the same titles and numbers, they no longer work in the printer I have and I got absolutely no sympathy or help despite the fact that some of the cartridges I got directly from hp as they replaced a fault printer and I had to send back the cartridges for the faulty printer and hp replaced with these which are no use.   No customer relation decency whatsoever."
199,Technical problem with an HP printer?  Best to buy a new non-HP printer.  HP only offers help via their software which simply does not work.  The only way to speak to a human being with this company is to buy something through yheir sales department.
200,"There is very bad service of hp,and Vaibhav and Kritika is a service centre staff,but they are talking rudely and not satisfied a customer solution,don’t purchase Hp laptop"
201,"With a huge frustration, I like to write here how poor HP customer service in Switzerland is, and hope they can react not for our case, and but for their devastating image: For the Spectre notebook that we bought last September, and now cannot be switched on, we called 4 times the service center at +41225675183 but could not get the service promised after each of those calls. On the first call, we were told that we could receive a new power cable at home. We did not receive anything. When we called HP a week later, the agent found that they had not taken any action, and organized a third party check at home. We were told we would be contacted by that third party. And, to find out the situation the HP service center would also call us for a follow up a week later. We did not hear anything neither from that third party, nor have we received a call from HP. When we called HP a week later, we were triaged to an English-speaking agent. After a long waiting, he said he could not do anything. Calling again, the new  agent promised that we would be contacted in two days. No reaction neither. After almost a month, we are waiting for a response from HP. They even claim that they can pick it up and send it to Hungary for a repair. Can you trust HP if that would work? Or even it works how long would it take?"
202,"Great computer - non-existant after sales:All the computers I have bought from HP have been really great machines but the aftersales help does not exist. HP will not take a complaint unless you write them a impersonal email and their reply is by email. You cannot get to talk to a human being about your problem. A manager callback is never available indeed I have been told by their complaints department that it is impossible to speak to a manager or have one call back. They even do not acknowledge the receipt of your email. If you want to be treated in this unfriendly and unhelpful way after you have bought one of their computers then go ahead and buy from HP. There computers are very good - their customer service is almost none existent.Update:. Eventually, after many emails I got to speak to a manager. He told me the number to put a complaint into. He said if you ring them they will arrange for a manager call back. I told him that this did not happen. Just to prove the point I rang the number that the manager had given me and asked for a manager call back. I was told HP does not arrange for managers to phone people back. Just what I told the manager, and just what he denied."
203,"They really should allow us to give zero stars because even doing 1 is pushing it. This is probably the worst customer experience we've ever dealt with. My boyfriend purchased a newer PC and the next day found an even newer one and wanted to cancel. It said to wait 24 to 48 hours. Well it was 48 hours and still nothing. He's contacted multiple representatives and they have all given him the runaround. He was told he entered information wrong, and when he asked what, he was told to not worry about it. He was then said to wait another 24 to 48 and if it's unable to be cancelled, he has to start a return and pay a restocking fee. RIDICULOUS! They're just holding it off as long as they can so he'd pay restocking fee. So we contacted our credit card company and disputed the charge. Do not purchase from this ""company"""
204,"Weeks wasted trying to switch printers in instant ink. You just get passed from one useless agent to another. Same questions, same procedures, same error messages, day in day out. Same resolution. I.e. none.The agents can't even be bothered to read the notes. And so you go through it all again. And even then they don't get what the issue is.I was even promised an escalation and they failed on that too. Nobody contacted me at all. So I contacted them again, and they again wanted to go through the pointless diagnostics!When you buy a printer choose wisely! HP customer service is close to be non-existent."
205,"If i could give it 0 i would. There is no customer service.  This is a prime example of a business trying to utilise modern technology to automate, but with absolutely no weights and measures to ensure any level of customer satisfaction. Its so poor when you try and leave fix the issue using their FAQ and online support, the chatbot AND the feedback don't work. Dont bother, buy something else with real support behind it."
206,"even one star rating is too much for this company.my partner bought a hp pavilion. one useless piece if s..t. cannot improve speed. takes hours to update, upload, doesn't recognise devices. i feel like smashing it to the wall each time i ever need to go online. that bad. i do not recommend anyone fall for the looks. buy something else"
207,"do not buy a HP printer. if you have a problem you cannot speak to them there is a chat room. this directs you to another company where you have to pay a fee. even on a brand new machine. HP used to make good printers now they are trash , just the =same as the service"
208,"Bought a HP Omen laptop which was fine, didn't have any issues.However, it seems I got lucky the first time. I then purchased a HP Omen desktop but it experiences regular crashes and the GPU keeps shutting off. It's clear there's some defect with the hardware.Tried getting help from HP but there's no obvious way to raise a support ticket. I spent extra on the 3 year warranty yet can't seem to get any help?Tried posting on the forum but they were just rude, unhelpful and condescending.I can see there are a lot of negative reviews on this site and yet HP doesn't even bother to respond to them. Company clearly doesn't care about it's customers."
209,"If I could give them zero stars I would. I bought a faulty toner cartridge for my HP printer. A genuine HP toner. The supplier of the toner said to rectify the issue I would have to get a case number from HP, I thought that would be easy enough, as I'd had a technician come out and diagnose the issue (at an expense of $200).  No, HP wanted me to give them (some random in a call centre) access to my mobile phone camera so they could look at the printer and the toner cartridge?  Why? I've given them all the details, all the relevant system print outs etc. I'm not giving god knows who unfettered access to my phone.  So I just had to buy a replacement toner, and as everyone knows they are not cheap. Such a disappointing experience. Zero customer service from an international company.  Disgusting."
210,"I sent a laptop off to HP to be repaired (faulty Keyboard, nothing technical) on 12/20/2023.  Ever since I have regularly received updated pushing the return date back, 3 in the last 3 days.  My new date is 3/31/2023, but they have not proven the date, delayed as it is is close to accurate.  To make matters worse, I have a second laptop with no battery life - I may give it a shot, but never will I purchase an HP product again,."
211,"Service is very poor, No body is responding for small problem I am struggling, I have smart tank HP printer & change the Network bought in Croma store, Better go for simpler printer & the  company gives proper service/Care"
212,"bought a 13"" Envy HP with 3 years warranty. Sent first time to get fixed of hardware issues, came back not 100%. tried to send second time, they make as hard as it can be (the process) and say i have to stay 15 days (minimum) without work computer and i have to back it all up to get it fixed....in other words....they dont want to and make any effort to help!!! terrible..."
213,"I bought a HP deskjet 3760 all in one printer, scanner, copier.Frustrating to set up and even worse when you want to change the ink cartridge. I spent £60 on two black cartridges that the printer doesn't seem to recognise. HP support is a joke . Steer clear and save yourself money and frustration. As for this 12 month old device...its going in the bin. I plan to buy one that works"
214,I received my new Color Jet Color MFP printer. I unpacked it and took out the setup documents. It directed me to an HP website to download the drivers. The list did not show my printer. So I called HP Technical Support on a Saturday afternoon. I got through to Technical Support within 5 minutes. And I spoke to Tom Ellis. He understood my problem and took over my computer. For the next 90 minutes he downloaded the drivers on 2 of my laptops and checked to make sure that all functions operated correctly. I have been an HP customer for over 12 years. I have bought many laptops and several printers. I have never had an issue with the quality of their products or customer support whether speaking to someone in the USA or India. I see many negative reviews but that has never been my own experience.
215,"Stay well clear of any HP products (especially UK): My printer continues to fail to establish WiFi connection, when speaking to HP they advised their products will only use 2.4Hz, which is not compatible with the standard UK WiFi network settings of 5Hz; therefore not fit for purpose & questionable why its even on the UK market. In addition to this, when the printer does have WiFi, it consistently crashes and requires rebooting. Spend the extra money and get yourself something half decent. Thanks me later!"
216,The HP OfficeJet Pro 8710 is NOT good for the environment! HP has a chip in it that forces you to only use the most up to date replacement cartridges from their approved retailers. We had new cartridges from Costco that would not use because it was 'too old'. Now we have extra cartridges that we cannot use or return. WTH?!
217,"Utter garbage of a brand and customer support.It is literally impossible to sign in on their website and communicate to an agent about issues you are experiencing with their product, as you have to go through rigorous verifications, to prove that you are human.Puzzles were confusing to me, namely, I had to select an animal that is on the correct way top (?!) and the test has 2 animals pointing on top so ok, and then I tried a visual puzzle, and even though I did that right another puzzle needed to be solved, and this time the volume was too high so that's why I am not allowed to sign up on their website.Thank you for making it easy for me to NEVER buy your products."
218,Thus is by far the worst company ever to deal with as far as the app and customer support... never buy HP product again....😡😱
219,"Ordered £6000 worth of office PCs 3 weeks ago. One item, a laptop was holding up the other two items. When I chased it the laptop had been discontinued but no one had bothered to tell us. Ordered an alternative comparable laptop on the advice of a HP salesperson, chased this and was told this too was discontinued!! As for the other PCs I ordered: one arrived Friday morning (3 weeks after ordering), the second one arrived, cunningly disguised as a printer! When I called up HP to advise, they were more interested in the details of the printer than getting out my PC unit to me! Word of advice: if I was going to scam you, I wouldn't do it with something cheaper!!Have now cancelled all orders with HP and will find another company to use. Had no idea HP had such a bad reputation but the thousands of reviews and lack of response from HP to them don't lie."
220,"My son bought an Omen 15 laptop which was expensive. After about 4-5 years the LCD started playing up and after some research we realised the fault lay with a ribbon cable. Not being in warranty we disassembled it and identified a part no. however we couldn't find one anywhere. The parts distributors were either dismissive because we weren't a business or useless because they didn't recognise the part no. So we contacted HP who took an age to respond, they too couldn't identify a correct order part number. (For some reason they seem to have twp part numbers?) To cut a long story short HP Support and suppliers were useless, we found the correct part eventually in China but just as were to order we got extremely lucky and found a second hand one on Ebay. As someone else on here advised, and as I said to my son (he didn't listen though) Do your research and steer clear of HP"
221,"25 days after the warranty, the desktop failed to boot with a 3F0 error.  All of the fn key tricks did not work, sending me into a never ending loop to nowhere.  This computer is 1 year and 25 days old.  Struggled with speed and could not use virtual backgrounds, had to buy external camera because the video was poor quality.  Do not buy this computer.  Hp desktop model 24-dd0010.  It is a waste of money."
222,"I bought a Pavillion desktop and an Envy laptop, Both top-end.  One just before Christmas and one last week. Both are now sent south to somewhere to be replaced. It is so tedious and time-consuming. The build quality seems nothing short of shocking.  How can they still be in business with so many returns?"
223,"Website is impossible to navigate. Trying to get help is nearly impossible. I want to know if what appears to be speakers next to the keyboard actually produce sound or not. Me, 5:34 PM""Did you get the image I sent?""karan ******, 5:34 PM""Yes.""Me, 5:35 PM""Is there a speaker there?""karan ******, 5:36 PM""Yes there is speaker and almost every laptop has the speaker.""That doesn't answer my question ""yes there is speaker""????????????? No really? it obviously has a speaker but is there a speaker on the side of the keyboard, or do all HP laptops now have the speakers underneath the laptop, muffling the sound? (See my profile picture)"
224,"HP DeskJet 2700 All-in-One Printer series.What the literature (and the wording on the box, if you are unfortunate enough to go into a _shop_) DOESN'T say is that this item has to be connected to the internet to work. For this model this means a WiFi connection so for those with out WiFi - stumped. The HP claim is that this is ""to make available enhancements"". ""Not working"" is an ""enhancement""?? Quite.In fact as this is a _printer_ and _scanner_  and (absent internet access) won't print or scan this is a Trades Descriptions Act issue. Trading Standards? Useless.Also HP used to be a premium company selling premium products at premium prices. This was a dirt cheap product but this ""internet-only"" constraint is just plain dirty tricks. Caveat emptor my a***e. This is a consumer product that doesn't."
225,"My wife and I purchased 2 x HP Notebook-17-ca1012na both have problems with the top screen hinges, I have looked up this issue and find it is a common problem. The Bezel sourounding the screen has started to come away.The laptops are slow to boot up and very laggy, we have a good internet connection and I am experianced in IT.We will avoid buying anything from HP in the future, its a shame as HP used to sell equipment that was well put together and had good performance.When"
226,"I recently had a printing issue with a hp smart tank (not a cheap bit of kit) which was still under warranty, the issue was finally resolved but took about 3 weeks, the online guidance is ""OK"" but trying to actually talk to someone to get further advice and assistance its frustrating to say the least, one wait in excess of 40 minutes on the phone and I ended up having to make several calls in order for the matter to be resolved, so BE WARNED if you need to call HP customer support be prepared for stress and frustration. All in all a very disappointing customer experience for such a global company, I expected better. And I see on here there are many 1 star reviews so it would appear my experience is not unusual!!!"
227,I wish I read these reviews before purchasing product.  The worst thing a company can do is have useless support staff. HP wins that title. I am not sure any other company can claim to have a team that is as useless as theirs.. HP READ THESE REVIEW IT IS ALL ABOUT YOUR SUPPORT TEAM.
228,Dreadful company to deal with ordered printer cartridges on their subscription terms paying £22 a month after the initial 6 months free trial what a disgrace I have cancelled my subscription and they still keep taking money out monthly 3 overpayments now I have sent numerous email and they just don’t care shocking company I have now decided to bin the printer I will never buy HP products again shocking!!!!!
229,"READ THE THOUSANDS OF REVIEWS AND CHOOSE A DIFFERENT COMPANY! Customer service is awful with the exception of Craig Kline who was the only person I spoke to with any common sense. All I wanted to do was buy a laptop and I was met with nothing but problems. Link didnt work, website crashed, out of stock yet states in stock, cannot get through on the phone, no call back, phone line diverts to wrong department and cannot be transferred after waiting over an hour on hold. Rude customer service team who just dont care. Please save yourself and order else where. Horrible company with average products.."
230,"If I had read these reviews before ordering,  I would never had ordered my printer online from HP direct. My printer arrived, set it up and it worked twice.  Two weeks later, after Christmas and New Year, went to use it again and get an error code on the screen. Husband contacted tech support and after trying a couple of solutions, there is no power supply to the printer. They have no idea what the error codes even meant.  I have now been on the phone 4 times to them as I did not want to accept a refurbished printer - how do I know where this printer has been or how much use it has already had.  If its refurbed, it has also failed and what's to say it won't fail again.  I have requested a refund, and raised a complaint on the 19th Jan - still waiting for a call back.  I've just been cut off by the agent because after 20 mins speaking to him, getting nowhere and told that someone will call me back (eventually!) I said that the customer service provided was s*** as my complaint has only today been escalated !!!!!  All I want is a new printer to replace the broken one, and as that is not going to happen, I want my money refunded to I can go to Currys to get another.  At least if something fails, they just give you a replacement.  Why did I ever go direct ?????  The most shocking service I have ever come across - the Directors and managers obviously never read these comments / reviews, because if I was one of them, I would be ashamed of working for HP !  My Advice - just go to Currys"
231,"One star is too many because HP does not offer customer support. Instead they have people answering the phone to walk through scripted troubleshooting steps which DO NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. Furthermore, they transfer you to another department, but no one answers. Instead they disconnect the call and close your ticket to make it look like they've resolved the issue. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER HP PRODUCT AGAIN!!!! APPLE ONLY MOVING FORWARD. IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE OF BUYING A PRODUCT THAT WILL ONLY FUNCTION FOR 2 MONTHS,BUY FROM A BRAND THAT RESPECTS AND APPRECIATE S YOUR PATRONAGE."
232,"I'm so frustrated with HP. There customer support is absolutely shocking for what is supposed to be a leading tech brand (or so I thought). I have always bought HP as I thought they were the most reliable company however, I received a faulty monitor and trying to get any support has been shocking. I have spoken to two guys from the support team, both of whom I wasted 1/5hrs talking to. To even get to this stage you have to navigate your way through their website. For anyone who isn't techy, they'd have a hard time speaking to someone and getting support."
233,"Utter utter rubbish, do not buy an HP laptop. I had one and it broke under warrantee, purchased another with money from HP for damaged product plus more from my pocket and it broke again and now they won't repair it even though it is under warrantee. I have been in a dispute with them for 3 months and they just pass you from piller to post, it is impossible to complain or speak with a supervisor, avoid at all costs., utter plastic rubbish."
234,"Printer cartridges are stuck.  Online help is useless.  I have been a supporter of HP in the past, but this has gone too far.  Because the printer is out of warranty (1 year) they won't help.I'M MOVING TO EPSON."
235,worst brand when it comes to printers and printer support. You'll spend hours wasting time trying to get printer issues sorted. NEVER AGAIN!!!
236,"Sell products NEW with warranties that start MONTHS before you have purchased the product. You cannot dispute the warranty as you never get a response from HP.Purchased a laptop NEW in DECEMBER 2022 and the warranty was started in SEPTEMBER 2022. This breaching trading standards by advertising a 12 MONTH warranty but only giving 9 MONTHS. Disputed the warranty twice, but despite being told I'd receive a response within one business day, its been a month."
237,"I bought hp laptop 23 december 2022. But after buying the laptop , i faced six(6) times wifi issue. but hp and customer care did not solve this till date. I think I should give a negative rating of the company products and after sell services both."
238,"Prepar to Wait All Day for Non RespondI ordered a laptop, and it came damaged. After weeks of emails back and forth, FedEx emailed me a return label. I sent it bak to HP 1/12/23, and FedEx tracking showed HP received the laptop on 1/16/23 at 11:39 AM. Yet, I have not received my money back as of today, 1/27/23. I called HP customer service twice, and there is no respond even after long wait !"
239,"First of all, DO NOT use the HP Instant ink program.  They bamboozle you i to thinking you’re just getting auto ink replacement when in fact they are fully monitoring every page you print on your printer.  Also, if you choose to cancel the service, expect your printer to stop printing immediately.  HP monitors the service and the second you cancel you are no longer allowed to use the ink that’s in your printer EVEN IF IT’S FULL.  I have never heard of such insanity.  Also, be ready for customer service to not only be unhelpful but also blatantly rude.  The representative I got actually told me to feel free to post my discontent across all of social media and then proceeded to list the outlets - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, to tell the world how unhappy I was with their service.  How condescending.  If I didn’t have a decent working printer I would actually toss the whole thing and go with a different brand.  That is how repulsive this entire situation is.  DO NOT ENROLL IN THIS PROGRAM IT IS A SCAM."
240,"Customer care at HP Laptop is very worst. None of them speak in the intention of providing solution. You will get exhausted when you are seeking their support.The case created at 30.12.2022 is still open, there is no response at customer care even after multiple reminders. Whatsapp support is also worst. each time you try to connect with them, you will have to give the same details again and again. the techncial support who comes in contact with will never give you a proper answer or guidance. I doubt if they try to understand what you are speaking. they send some copy paste message, most of the times irrelevant to the message we communicate or the issue.its highly exhausting, tiring, costs time and at the end no solution.they also dont keep the call back promise for technical support.Really very very dissapointed"
241,Worst customer service if you can even call it that takes weeks or months to resolve anything on my 2nd latop that needs to be replaced. Monkeys could do a better job than these clowns
242,"I purchased this computer and received it on 12/22/2023 as a Christmas gift to my son.  The computer was set up on 01/05/ 2023 and damaged not by any fault of my child. The screen is not working and HP refuse to do anything about it . The computer came with a defective screen. I reached out to them on the 8 and did not get any response . I attempted again on the 9, 10, 11, 12 and several days with no avail. Now on the 26th HP is telling me there is nothing they can do about it"
243,I bought a HP neverstop MFP 1202nw. the damn thing never starts firstly I have to connect to it by wifi because it did not come with a cable. then there is always some problem. resetting passwords and messing around with connection issues. the worst printer I have ever had. the printer I had 20 years ago was more reliable.
244,"Placed order for ink January 15, 2023. HP claims to have a 3-5 day delivery time. UPS didn't even receive it until Jan. 18 and last scan was Jan.19.  As of January 26 I still haven't received it. Contacted HP Customer Service and they put it all on me to deal with the issue.  Update: Ink finally arrived January 30th---shortly after I emailed HP that I would like a refund. Suddenly the package that appeared lost in the system showed up in tracking after that email. I don't know if it was HP, UPS, or both working together, but I will not order from HP.com again. Customer service was terrible, IMO. With this transaction, their 3-5 day delivery statement was as much a joke as their customer service."
245,"Trying to get a repair under warranty is just a complete joke. Tried to contact Customer service you have to wait for them to call you back.1st time They called back and just allowed the phone to ring once only (so they can say customer never answered) 2nd,3rd & 4th Time of trying, No reply at all.5th Time I got a call and answered it straight away to stop them cutting me off. I got as far as explaining the issue, when the operator got bored and cut me off.6th,7th Time of trying, again, no call back.8th time, get call back, answer quickly, and explain the issue, the operator then wanted me to go through a 6 hour diagnostic, which I explain has been done four time before and does not solve the issue. She tells me and I quote. "" I give you my word that I will call you back at 18:00 today to see the results"" she says this three times and pulls the plug.Yes, 18:00 come and goes, and so does 19:00,20:00, ect and no call back.HP you are nothing more that legalised criminals that take peoples money and just walk away when things go wrong.Please think VERY hard before you buy HP, they just don't give a @#@5$3."
246,Trying get a printer warranty sorted is a joke whats app chat takes at least 3 days and then still never gets sorted spoke to someone on the phone just did know what they was doing I would never buy an hp product again because there customer service is a disgrace
247,"The service representative was helpful, but everything else sucked! DON'T USE THE INSTA-INK SUBSCRIPTION--there are serious issues with shady manipulation and privacy.I cancelled by Insta-ink subscription and removed my credit card number from the website. I assumed they would let me know if there were a balance due. Several weeks later, my printer would not print because of a HP account issue. After a very confusing 10 minutes working through the telephone system, I was finally able to talk to a human being. Her script caused us to take another 10 minutes to determine that I owed $4. After another 10 minutes of navigating the web, I was able to add a new credit card to my online account and the account was paid off. However, the printer was still held captive by the HP software. The service representative was able to fix this by completely removing my printer from the HP system, BUT NOW THE INSTA-INK CARTRIDGES THAT I PAID FOR WILL NOT WORK IN MY PRINTER-- I have to buy commercial HP cartridges before I can print again.In addition to this possible fraud, there may be a larger problem of privacy. If the Insta-ink cartridges and the printer are sending information to HP about the condition of the special cartridges and the number of pages printed, WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION THEY MAY BE COLLECTING?I'm very glad that we've cut our electronic and financial ties with HP!"
248,"First level support told me they were sending me to second level support but they would be there with me until the connection was made. That was a lie, was shoved into a queue for 30 minutes of elevator music. Hung up, called again, first level support said same thing, was shoved into elevator music queue for another 10 minutes. Hung up, called again, first level support said they were having issues with my printer model (a lie, I later surmised) and they would call me next day at 1:30 pm. No call came. Ya gotta figure things out on your own with HP printers."
249,"I have never had some much stress from a printer in my life!!Never works when you need it to.Ridiculous.....Drops wifi connection constantly.When does actually work, will printing stop printing half way through and bark on with issues with my account.If like me you want a printer to work when you need it..Do not buy an hp printer..more precisely, hp envy 6000 all in one..AVOID like the plague..I have an instant ink plan. Some months i wont print a single page. Even for months I wont use it. Then occasionally I need to print 30 pages for work. It will instantly stop you printing.Stop the printer working!!!so for months iv paid my subscription for the fun of it.Then when i actually need it to work.. Nothing..I hate it..Gone are the days when you press print and you actually get what you want.Save your money.As you can see, not worth the stress.I now have an exam at work in the morning. I cant print off my revision, the app will not communicate with my printer.Lets not forget i brought this printer out right for a sum. i pay a monthly subscriptionNow i am going to have to pay for a failed exam at work, because my printer says it wont do it..Thanks for listening..."
250,"I got a replacement for the first laserjet, the replacement was worse and had even more problems. I was on the phone (their support number 020 7660 0403) being transferred and on hold for over half an hour, I started in India (was told they do not look after LJs), then I went somewhere Nordic (they did not support LJs) and ended up in France with someone who could not speak English. I have had to start again."
251,"If there was an option for no star I'd have chosen that. I was unable to connect to my printer via wi fi because HP didn't recognise my printer...so tried to get help from HP.  The phone number is a high charge number so people can't afford to spend hours on there just to give HP more money.   Eventually I managed to find a WhatsApp and on 6th January I sent a message asking for help.   There were SO MANY people needing help that I was kept waiting a long time for a reply to each message, by which time they'd forgotten my reply so I was asked the same questions repeatedly.  This went on for HOURS.  I was by then really annoyed.  I asked many times for an email address but was told there isn't one.  Nothing was resolved.  I've not been able to print for several weeks  but still getting charged each month for ink, despite cancelling it twice!!  They could see I wasnt using the ink.  Its an absolute farce.   Yesterday I thought I'd try once more for help but the same thing happened..  30 minutes before a reply on WhatsApp.  I was told again they had technical problems.   After several hours I told them to please remove all my details from their data base because I no longer wanted anything to do with HP. This morning I received a message asking can they help me with anything else!!!!NEVER have I had such BAD BAD service from any company.  No wonder they don't want us to phone them.. they wouldn't have enough staff to cope with all the complaints."
252,"Horrible Horrible product and even worse customer service!!! I purchased an HP Deskjet 2700 wireless printer. After using it a few times, it went offline. I tried to troubleshoot and it would not work so I called customer service. After about an hour they reconnected my printer and it worked for two more days. My printer went offline again so I called again and was on with them to troubleshoot for over an hour. Do you see a pattern here??? Anyway, I do not have time to call HP every time my printer goes offline. They say it is my Wi-Fi connection but right before this printer I had a wireless printer and I never had that trouble! Here we are three months later and I cannot return the printer to Walmart.  Last week I was on the phone three hours each night for three days in a row. I asked them to just send me a new printer since it is still under warranty ( I only had it 3 months)  but they refused. This one is going to the trash! I will never buy an HP again!"
253,"I started at 9am this morning, it is now 5:30pm.  I spoke with a technician that couldn't help, then a supervisor that said I would speak to a 'case manager' that called me back 7 hours later.  (Supervisor, Nathan, said it would be 15 min.) This is recidulous!  Heaven help me find a good printer that doesn't break down in 4 months. (This is the 3rd in 2 years)  On another venue... they put you on hold... total silence... have they dropped me?  do I stay on the line?  What now???  I stuck it out at first... every 10 to 15 min some one would come back on the line and say that they were in the process of....  whatever.  SO  ANGRY AM I!"
254,HP sells junk computers. They collapsed less in one year. The company does not honor the warranty and asks the customer to reinstall the windows on their own on the dead screen.
255,"I have a Z Book from HP, I had raised a ticked or lodged a complaint with HP that my machine gets extremely hot and also some of keys are not functioning. I was called from the call center and was told someone will visit me at home. NO ONE EVER CAME TO VISIT ME FOR A MONTH and then I find an email sent to me by HP that my ticket or complaint has been closed and the engineer had written that Customer will be available only after June.  A best service feedback has also been filled on behalf of me. AND MY QUERY STILL TO BE UNRESOLVED. I am regretting purchasing HP. would never ever recommend HP to anyone ever. Horrible service. It is useless to have an amazing product with the worst ever service."
256,"Taken them three days of On / Off availability on WhatsApp as they keep going AWOL for hours on end. Then they’ll come back with something helpful like “Try unplugging your printer at the base and the plug for at least 60 seconds” THREE DAYS and still have a broken printer. Is there anything more soul destroying than trying to fix a printer? Yes, trying to do it via HP WhatsApp Chat and being continuously ghosted by an incompetent moron."
257,Laptop is ok but Trade-in external service took 3 months to process and send my $150.Customer Service on France Website are mostly down.
258,"Do not buy HP. Save your money.I have now had two terrible experiences with HP products. First, I got an HPx360 Envy laptop a few years ago. Half of the keyboard does not work - with no apparent reason. It lags. Overall the quality and build of this laptop is not good.I have also purchased an HP monitor which I use occasionally. With no explanation once again, today I go to use my monitor and the screen does not work.I will never buy HP products again."
259,"Actually surprised at how many bad reviews there are considering the nature of the company. I thought it was just my bad luck. Even before seeing all the other bad reviews I knew I'd never buy another HP product again. Now, I 101% will never be a customer for HP again. I spent several hundred pounds on a laptop which regularly gives me grief with the software. The issues I regularly face are not being able to connect to WiFi as it will randomly refuse to search for networks after going into sleep mode. Sometimes I'll go to turn it off and the screen just goes blank as if its suddenly forgotten how to completely shut down; so the keyboard will still be responsive and light up and I have to physically hold onto the on/off button. These issues started within the first few weeks of ownership and have been persistent regardless of software updates or 'reporting' issues when prompted by the system. I think I'll be sticking to Apple now although more expensive. I owned a MacBook Pro for ten years prior to buying the HP and never once had a software issue. You'd think after creating tech products for long enough they could iron out relatively annoying issues and be competent enough to compete with competitors. Pitiful."
260,"Appalling After Sales service, numerous calls, texts, chats, emails and no service in relation to a faulty X34 monitor. I’ve used HP numerous times, never again, due to an abysmal service.Having bought direct from HP, I expect a like for like replacement, i.e. new, when something goes wrong, not to be told I’d receive a refurbished model. Buy a refurbished model off eBay and take your chances. I don’t see the point in buying from HP. Their 1 year warranty is only valid for 30 days!"
261,"Terrible after purchase service on a newly purchased wireless printer.Only failed pages printed, nothing successful. Nealy 20 hours of my time taken with self diagnosis, chat line help, phone help, senior customer service manager help, multiple tech call outs. What a waste of HPs time! First call to SVITA or someone in a backward country was hopeless. Terrible connection, shocking experience. Next call to an engineer NEEL who claimed to be in Australia, only to reveal later when caught out he was also in a backward part of India. Terrible lie. Hours on voice call, video call, questioning, troubleshooting, all with no outcome. Tech called, arrived for one minute onsite, only to advise the call out was to verify the fault. Not fix the issue, just verify there was a fault. Although, SIMON the call out tech was a Gentleman. Just obviously brainwashed to believe HP deliver quality customer service that puts the customer first. I would actually call it a cult. I digress. Printer not working, I am advised to send parts away (the most likely faulty toner cartridge) to a postal address at my own cost!! A senior customer service rep for HP from Sydney I believe called me, another wate of time. Promising the world, noting fixed. But their cheat sheet palm cards probably blue tacked to every HP employee's computer is full of buzz words, promises no to stress, that they would solve the issue and blessings of not to worry. Again, this is called a cult folks. Built on mass producing large volumes, most of the time getting it right and when it does go wrong, bending the customer over without the decency of offering up any lube first before the sting. I digress. Under warranty, technically under Australian consumer law, a customer should be no worse off than if they bought a working machine as it is supposed to work. Consumers should not be out of pocket i.e. worse off financially by paying for parts under warranty, to be sent away! I am advised a 2 week wait for a replacement cartridge to arrive in Brisbane... By now, I am quite sure HP are simply just taking the pi$$ out of the consumer, this is ridiculous. A week later with no resolve, out of the blue SIMON advises a new cartridge has miraculously arrived and can be installed next business day. Think for a minute, the cost of one of these cartridges would be far less than the time it took for everybosy at HP to jerk me off not to mention the time of the tech to drive across town, cost of fuel, cost of staff, green house emissions of the vehicle etc. Other than big business who does not give a flying rats rectum about customer service, name me a business that can afford to blow dollars costing themselves more by delivering bad customer service?I digress. Cartridge toner has just been replaced, printer working, so, so simple. The autopsy on the faulty toner cartridge and what looked like a microchip and its condition was somewhat confusing? After hours of online diagnostics and questioning, to be asked if I genuinely thought this printer had only ever printed 29 pages as was showing up on the HP app page. Do I look like a hacker from Anonymous??However, the printer is working, I cannot wait to sell it on Marketplace and buy a more reliable brand as was recommended to me by retailers - stay away from HP, buy Lexmark or Cannon. If the team selling the stuff have little confidence in HPs service commitment, something must be going off like a fish milkshake. Thanks for reading, stay safe, don't buy HP and all the best Folks!"
262,It is a shame there is not an option for no stars. I brought a monitor from HP and after 10 uses the screen cracked from inside. A fault others have talked about online. I have not contacted them no less than 4 times. The technical support is rude and unhelpful. The first piece of advise I was offered was buy a new one. Every time I call them they tell me they will get back to me. This has now happened 4 times over many weeks. My advise avoid this company and their products as if there is an issue they will not care and most certianly not help you AT ALL!
263,"I have bought HP printers for 12 years for my busines primarily to print A5 300 dpi invoices in black on white paper.I had to replace in October 2022 as the last one was no longer repairable, sad because it was an easy to use workhorse HP 8610. I called HP and asked for recommedations on the nearest comparable machines to this model. Officejet pro 9014e was one of three. I needed to be able to email jobs to printer and to scan to network folders so went with HP Officejet pro 9014e IN October 2022. The printer arrived with four cartridges marked HP963. When asking for a recomendation I had said I would buy genuine while under warranty but would then buy remanufactured, not HP due to cost. I opted out of HP ink as in the past that worked out three times as expensive. The machine was the most difficult to set up, you need to set up HP smart First then operate via  hub. I gave up with scan to network it just didn't work. I have been in three support calls with technician who each set it up but when it was turned off at the machine it lost the ability and I had to seek support again. I needed to print an A5 text document in black with two lines of text at 300dpi I received a notification that I would need to replace blue ink soon. After printing one page as described the printer gave a message to say replace blue (cyan) depleted cartridge and would I like to print in black only. I clicked to do so and printed one such page. I then received notification that yellow was depleted. I removed the blue and shook it, it still felt heavy and sounded as though it had a good quantity of ink. I checked the levels of black, yellow and pink. Black was showing as more than half full, while yellow and pink were low but not empty. I put the blue back in and immediately received a notification that pink (magenta) was depleted. I had not printed anything since checking levels, and only had printed in black.I have a 3 year extended warranty and called HP asking why I received no notification that I needed to purchase ink now. And all three colours didn't run low but ran out on the same day with only the same day notification on blue (cyan). Automatic notification is set up on all four colours on the printer. Support told me that the status isn't accurate and the notification doesn't work on the cartridges supplied with the machine.HP+ Is to stop you using other makes. HP can see from my records that I used genuine cartridges for the first five years of my last printer. I believe HP sent a message to the printer to stop working today. What other reason for all three colors 'running out' on the same day, within 10 minutes of each other when they are half full of ink at least, by weight and sound. I have a full and an empty HP cartrigde here from another hp printer and have weighed them. The cartridges from the new printer are over half the weight of the empty cartridge.Even if you don't believe the theory of HP being able to control the printer cartridges I still have the problem of scan to network not working and need another support agent to take control of my computer and fix it again. I am off to find out how to stop HP+ Printers from updating automatically.   I am been so happy with previous purchases so why make the range so complicated and controlled, why do I need to prove the ink is genuine. I use genuine in the HP printer I use for photos."
264,"Been using HP printers for ages, I have 30+ across my network. Recently purchased the new M110we printers - utter crap - I do not want to sign up for instant ink you clowns - never again, dont bother."
265,"What a joke. Bought a HP laptop which had a trade in reward associated with it.  After waiting the stipulated 15 days I sent in my qualifying trade in laptop.  After 3 months HP have responded stating that I was not successful as my trade in had Shiny keys!, a minor scratch and faulty touchpad (although I've used it for two years without any issue).  You can't challenge their decision and the report is final.So thanks for buying our laptop and we'll take all your money......."
266,"Their printer-scanners are terrible. They crop out corners in scanning and copying. Their customer care is worse. They took one year to admit the fault after multiple denials and then they refused to release a firmware patch to fix it, saying that it will help their competitors. Their expensive laptop was also abysmally bad."
267,"Purchased a new laptop in November 21 and took out the 3 year extended care package. Since June 22, it has been back 3 times because of wifi driver faults and never lasted long after being returned as 'fixed'. Some of the online chat folk are ok, others patronising and condescending. They seem to forget that they are doing a job that they are trained for, and some of us are not quite that tech savvy. But, when one asked me if there was someone else here to carry out his instructions!!!!!!! Anyway, wifi driver is playing up again, I get a message across the screen at start up that says 'tablet is starting'. It's a laptop that never used to say that. One game loads in Landscape briefly, when it should be portrait. And now the fan is running more frequently and louder than ever before. So, I shall cut my frustration time and ditch this useless heap. HP = Highly Problematic. Never again."
268,Do not buy Chromebooks from HP without an extended warranty. We have 30 chromebooks that have all developed EXACTLY the same fault - swollen/dangerous batteries - and been told we are just 'unlucky'. Advice has been to not use and scrap the devices as they are at risk of catching on fire. As a Primary School resources such as these are so valuable to the childrens education. To find our £7500+ worth of equipment is deemed scrap after just 4 years of very little use is VERY DISAPPOINTING! We have no budget to replace them as all budgets are now on hold. HP are dismissing our requests for help. As is our reseller. We will never buy HP devices again and will be advising that all schools in our area avoid HP products.
269,"Printers and their instant Ink and paper service.This sounds like a great idea. HP automatically sends out ink low through the ""Instant Ink"" account. When you sign up, you give them your credit card, and they continue to charge you each time your ink is low. The problem is, for some reason, your card is no longer working. They say they try to contact you, and if they cannot, they do not allow you to print anything until you give them a valid credit card. THEY SHUT DOWN my ability to print. I NEVER GIVE THEM THAT RIGHT. So, if my card does not work, do not send me ink. DO NOT FORCE ME to use your product, that is my choice and not yours.DO NOT BUY an HP printer, and do not sign up for ""Instant INK."" Talk about BIG BROTHER they invade your privacy."
270,"DO NOT BUY A HP PRINTER THEY ARE A RIP OFF, THE PRINTER MAY BE CHEAP TO BUY BUT THEY WILL STING YOU ON THE INK WHERE THEY REALLY PROFIT.  YOU CANNOT SUCCESFULLY REFILL THE CARTRIDGES AND OFTEN 3RD PARTY CARTRIDGES ARE HIT AND MISS."
271,My £1000 PC has been in repair for 4 months. It is under warranty and HP want to charge £400 to fix the internal power port which I obviously have not intended to damage (it just broke). I refused to pay. They have promised to escalate around 4 times and never come back to me. The only way I can get any response is via Twitter direct message but still made no progress. In the meantime we have lost our home PC and my kids are struggling to do their homework. I've asked multiple times for the formal complaints procedure and they seem unable to produce it. I'm not normally a complainer - but never experienced such awful all round service. I will NEVER buy HP products again.
272,Great printers and Gaming PC’s and Computers. I really like the OMEN Gaming Laptop Range and Windows operating system. Sometimes there are problems on my printer and gaming pc. For example memory loss and countles crashes but I eventually fixed it and printers sometimes malfunction and having trouble connecting to the internet but other than that it’s still good
273,"HP has a great customer service. Yes, it took me more then hour to get my problem solved, but I worked at call center, they do well, believe me :) Everyone super polite and do all instructions. I like empathy they are trying to show and all the advices are good. Thanks to guy from Canada department, who was talking to me 1pm - 2 pm pacific time. Pay him bonus, he solved my issue with return))"
274,"HP is probably the worst company I've ever had to deal with when there are issues with their products. No support, the virtual agent is useless and there's no information to be found anywhere on your website that relates to the problems I'm having with my hp printer. I can print a test page just fine but nothing else. I've tried on my phone and my laptop and nothing. Print jobs either just sit in the queue or I get an error message with no helpful information about what the problem actually is!! I have uninstalled and reinstalled the printer and the HP smart apps. I have restarted my laptop, phone and printer multiple times and nothing. Complete crap and there's no way to get in touch with a human person without having to pay them more money by buying support for their own non working products!! Insanity"
275,"HP raises the prices and then gives a discount. This is misleading the consumer, because the discount is minimal. Incidentally, this is a criminal offense in the European Union to mislead the consumer.In addition, I want to warn people about PC deal TRADE-IN. Always keep your track and trace. They steal your laptop and you can whistle for your money for the old laptop."
276,my printer from HP photo 7830 is just rubbish never work properly maybe few time in year and hardly connect even Ive done everything I need to do and make so many call to hp and never done anything for me and pay monthly for what ????
277,"HP will lie to you. Restock fee may apply, really means restocking fee will apply. Then they will lie to you and tell you they cannot resell your unopened, unused, product you are trying to return. That is a lie, and a blatant one. That's where they sort of lose their moral ""fine print"" high ground.I have transcripts to back it up and I have never heard anything quite as f------ stupid in my life. I bet they are going to throw it away and ""eat the loss."" How comical. This company is apparently still operating in the year 2005 and think their customers are stupid. Absolutely no reason to give these people business and I will make sure nobody I know will either.If you're going to hide behind fine print, then make sure your fine print can only be interpreted in ONE WAY. RESTOCKING FEE WILL APPLY, you tricksters."
278,"After paying in good faith for extended warranty, I have had an awful experience. After trouble shooting a fault I was promised an exchange.   Eventually this arrived and as soon as it was plugged in it had errors.I called HP support. Was on the line for just under an hour with the agent but I probably only spoke with the agent for 15 mins she spent the rest of the time checking with her mentor.  Now I am getting another replacement. I hope they actually repaired this one and not just send one that someone else had a problem with. In the meantime I've had to go out and buy a new printer as I run a small business and this has caused me huge issues.Hp printers are good. Support is absolutely dreadful. I asked for the complaints team but apparently there isn't one. I wonder why."
279,"Beware the Black Friday deal!!Like many companies, they extend their replacement warranty from 30 to 60 days over the Christmas period but what they don't tell you is the extension starts on actual Black Friday (25th November) not the date their Black Friday Deals go live (21st) I brought a high-end Victus laptop for my son on the 22nd and he didn't get it until the 31st of December due to being away. On the 6th of Jan it died in a death boot up loop so only worked for 6 days. Initially they offered me a replacement and then retracted the offer. I am now having to wait for them to collect it under the extended warranty I also brought and need to allow 10 working days to get it back. How can a company offer a swap and then change its mind?Regardless of that, the Christmas swap extension should cover the whole of their Christmas promotion not start halfway through it."
280,"Have a laptop (under warranty). Needed software BIOS repair in Nov, same issue again now in Dec. Sent back nearly 5 weeks ago. Now they claim there is liquid damage to the device. It went in for same software issue and nothing to do with liquid damage. Now they are refusing to carry out the work. There is absolutely no customer service at all. Not able to speak to management at all. All the staff do is apologies and promise to call back yet they never do. I would not rate even 1 star. Ive lodged a complaint but lets see if anyone actually calls me back. Very poor after care service from HP!"
281,I am most angry because I can no longer use my former old printer that has worked for years and still physically works because of HPs new software. It's clear they're practicing planned obsolescence- they either want me to buy a new printer to print and scan or give them my data for them to sell. Just got a new HP laptop and it is truly awful. Every time I use it something new on it doesn't work.
282,"Before, I could just call up and speak to an operator.Now they have an automated voice recognition system.It does not work.I spent 40 minutes trying to get through and speak to someone."
283,NEVER EVER BUY A PRINTER FROM THESE THIEVES AND CHARLATONS.
284,Not possible to connect to a printer I purchased only 3 years ago. Can't download even simple drivers. THeir website wants to send you round in circles until you agree to send them all data. A joke. Will never buy another HP. Just charge an honest price for an honest proiduct.
285,"HP Case Number: 5098152401----------------------------------------------------------2 February 2023 - The engineer appointment has been cancelled again because the part isn't available! This is the fifth time the appointment has been cancelled. ----------------------------------------------------------31 January 2023 - I communicated with HP via WhatsApp. I explained it had been two weeks since they promised me a call from their Customer Relations team to arrange a replacement computer or full refund, as no-one from the CRT had called me. They said a replacement computer had been authorised but the team responsible had forgot to action it and the case had been closed!Meanwhile I was advised that the part to repair my faulty computer was now in stock and they could carry out the repair to my computer. I agreed to this on condition that they could assure me that the part was in stock. I was assured it was. The engineer visit is booked for the 2nd February 2023. This will be the fifth engineer appointment that has been booked.  ----------------------------------------------------------26th January 2023 - I haven't heard from HP this morning so I can only presume that the part never arrived. This is the fourth time an engineer visit has been planned and cancelled. Again, I have suggested to both HP and Hemmersbach to wait for the part to arrive before booking the engineer visit.          ------------------------------------------------------------25th January 2023I was contacted by HP to arrange an engineer visit the following day. I asked whether they had confirmation that the part was available before agreeing an appointment. They said their system was showing an ETA of the following morning. I pointed out that this is what happened on three previous occasions and on the day of the engineer visit that part wasn't actually in stock.I suggested that they check that the part has actually arrived and to contact me the following day to arrange an appointment.I have suggested to both HP and Hemmersbach to wait for the part to arrive before booking the engineer visit.         ------------------------------------------------------------22nd January 2023On the 16th January I was promised by the technical support team that a member of customer service would contact me within 48 hours to arrange a replacement computer or full refund.     It is now 6 days and I haven't been contacted. There is no customer service contact details or customer complaints section on the website, so they cannot be contacted directly. You have to wait for them to contact you. It has now been two weeks since I received the faulty computer and I have been unable to either have it repaired, replaced with a new one or refunded in full. And I have to keep chasing HP. ------------------------------------------------------------18th January 2023I was contacted by Hemmersbach - the company that carries out repairs for HP - to arrange an engineer visit. I asked whether they had confirmation that the part was available before agreeing an appointment. They said their system was showing an ETA of the following morning. I pointed out that this is what happened on two previous occasions and on the day of the engineer visit that part wasn't actually in stock.I suggested that they check that the part has actually arrived and to contact me the following day to arrange an appointment.I haven't heard from since so I can only assume the part still hasn't arrived. I have suggested to both HP and Hemmersbach to wait for the part to arrive before booking the engineer visit.         ------------------------------------------------------------16th January 2023The rearranged engineer visit that I was promised by 13th January never materialised and I wasn't contacted by anybody at HP.Today I was informed that there is a worldwide shortage of parts due to Covid-19 and civil unrest, and as a consequence they cannot give me a date of when the parts will be in stock.I pointed out that new computers should not be sold if there isn't a minimum amount of stock to support any failures.I have requested a replacement computer or full refund. I have been guaranteed that the customer service team will contact me no later than 48 hours from today.------------------------------------------------------------11th January 2023 -Further to my review yesterday the engineer visit that was cancelled yesterday was re-scheduled for today. I was assured the part was in stock and the engineer visit would take place. At 11.30am I received an email saying the visit had been cancelled due to the unavailability of parts!What a shambles.   ------------------------------------------------------------"
286,Abysmal products. Would rather fall off a bridge than ever use a product from them again
287,Thieves and liars.I have attempted to cancel my HP print many times and everyone I call up to cancel. I have been assured that it is 'been cancelled' to look at my bank account to see them still charging me and not refunding me for a service I do not want. I can't block it either my bank account won't let me.I would not recommend using their services and their customer service is a joke.
288,"Returned as instructed, no refund, I even sent proof of delivery. No response from HP.  Have had to open dispute with credit card company."
289,We have had an HP Officejet 4500 Wireless for more than a few years now. A few years before that we a 'Brother' a very good or at least more reliable brand with good Customer Support. This Officejet is a bloody joke and spends most of it;s and our time NOT working. I spent over an hour online trying to get it working then another hour with Customer Service who could barely speak English and didn't seemed vey concerned for my growing frustration. I would nominate Hewlett Packard as the 'Worst American Company of the Decade' they suck. NEVER buy their products OR let Staples talk you into buying one even if on sale!
290,"I have a HP Pavilion laptop which is a few years old. It doe not have the up to date software for Windows 11 so is now totally useless. Battery is rubbish, it keeps shutting down, it constantly needs ""Disk"" repair on it, also needs daily clearing of cache. No support from HP so I would never buy another laptop from HP. Not impressed at all."
291,"Back in September 2021, I purchased a printer directly from HP.  I usually go to Best Buy but they did not have the particular one I needed in stock (scan to email feature).  I purchased the additional 3 year HP Care Pack Warranty.  Printer has worked fine until last night.  Scan to email stopped working.  I contacted HP Tech and they troubleshooted for over 1 hour with no luck.  I also found out that my warranty was never registered so they were showing my warranty being expired.  After getting my warranty ""registered"" I was told I could utilize it after midnight when everything downloads into the system.  Here I am the next morning... I was initially told troubleshooting - AGAIN - no way!  I demanded a manager.  Transferred to Cloud services.  I don't want an alternative through an app.  I want the scan feature as it always worked.  Now waiting to be transferred to 4th person this morning in the past hour.  They have the worst support for printers!"
292,Should have read the reviews. Expensive printer that doesnt function. Don't waste your money on HP. Unfortunately I have!
293,Wish I would have read these reviews before buying. Please do not buy from HP. I have been on to technical support 3 times now spending 2 hours of my time. They have now suggested I contact Microsoft !! Looking to send back the print to HP and to use a better company
294,It beggars belief. In order to use your own scanner you now have to open an account with HP. Why?? We own the printer! Why on earth should we need an account to use it?? We didn't need an account with the previous driver (so we're forced to download the new version) and then find we can't use the product WE OWN to scan something until we have an account with you?!
295,"There so much wrong to this company that I will probably miss something while leaving this review.1. They don’t reply back to emails at all2. Their staff are not professional and can not fix a printer, they need to be trained better3. My old HP just stopped working and miraculously could not connect to the network, after speaking to a specialist outside of HP I was advised that a lot of companies limit the access of older model printers to their network leading to people to think that it is unfixable and buying a new one. Needless to say that this is illegal.4. HP charged me for instant ink plan for 3 months even though I contacted them several times that my printer is not working and they could not fixe it! They DENIED refunding me the money and offered me a free month if I continue to pay for instant ink for the same printer that does not work. Being absurd and insolent is the least I can say that HP staff are. 5. I asked to speak to a manager 7 times in total and the staff DENIED arranging me a call with one, advising me that they don’t have a manger and that they can not help me = a manager would not be able to help me. HP are expensive, unprofessional, arrogant and do not have good customer service."
296,"They are an appalling company the worst I have experienced after 20+ years of shopping online. I purchased a gaming monitor and the HDMI port was faulty. I spent the best part of almost 2 weeks being passed from What’s app, to email and then via numerous telephone calls just to get a returns authorised. I returned the goods Via Parcelforce and they had the item back at their warehouse on 13/12/2022. It took them 3 weeks and 3 days to process the return and refund. I spoke to a total of 7 customer service All who couldn’t care less and their attitude was it will take as long as it takes. I finally got the refund on the 5 January 2023 after complaining to Klarna that I still didn’t have a refund after 3 and a half weeks. Avoid HP at all costs unless buying from a shop with good customer service."
297,"HP is absolutely the worst company ever to deal with. Their products are CRAP. From day one they don't work, their customer service is a joke and the poor customer is left tearing their hair out NEVER, EVER again will I buy their products. Pure Crap. My Printer has not worked from day one, I have to contact their crap support everytime I want to use it and that means waiting hours for online support or being on hold for ages on the phone. Who can afford this waste of time and energy. DO NOT BUY HP! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
298,Made the mistake of ordering a printer from the HP online store.  Bad decision.  Lied to me about delivery date.  Bad communication with reps.  Should have just gone to Best Buy or anyplace else.  Could have walked out with the product.
299,have a HP pavilion 15-cx0056wm gaming laptopand the screw's holding the screen onto the hinges striped when i opened and closed it. This happened 3 times with 3 different front and back plate's the plastic is so crappy it just keeps happening and tried to get help for a better quality so it stops happening but customer support didn't help and kept transferring my call until i end up at a place that said they could help me and i had to pay $50 a month and then told me to pay them $300 to repair it. Worst laptop design I have ever seen and worst customer support I have ever experienced.
300,"Appalling service. I subscribed to the Instant Ink service. The first cartridge did not get delivered successfully so got returned to the supplier. I received an email asking me to trigger a reshipment. The email didn't even provide a direct link to trigger the shipment. Went on the website and there's nowhere to do this. So I sought for additional support hoping I could speak to an agent. Was asked by a virtual assistant to create a case - no idea why I have to do this job for them, even at Virgin Media I don't have to create a case for myself. After all the hassle of opening a case I was told the service was not available. So yeah, I wasn't able to get in touch with any live agent. This is a joke. Utter incompetence. Will only recommend this service to my worst enemies. I'll never purchase any HP printers ever again."
301,Bought a HP Smart Tank Plus 559 Wireless All-in-One printer and have recently changed internet provider. There is no way to find any information on how to change this touchscreen-less printers internet connection form either there online support system or any documentation online. Why be so secretive about how to use their product? So they can charge you to phone and ask about a simple problem which should have been simple to resolve.
302,"The live chat only knows 3 things, one of which is ink replacements. You can get it to do other things, but only by clicking on one of four options which may not match your issue.There is a button to click on for pc/laptop support (it says pc but there is a picture of a laptop for some reason.) This allows you to create a case number, but then you have to ring up to get support. I don't mind this, but the phone agents never asked for the case number so what's the point? The email with the case number doesn't have the phone line on it and the case numbers are not stored anywhere so you have to make another case number in order to make the phone call.The first option is whatsapp which is not a ubiquitous technology and I don't trust WA or Facebook.20 minutes into the call the line went dead but they did call me back which was great.There is no rough indication on prices for repair which would help me to know if it was worth bothering with the process, e.g. £200 vs £800 makes a big difference.The case number for hp is 5096882962."
303,"I would give no stars if I could. I wanted to get my ""obsolete"" printer (according to HP customer service) fixed because I broke the screen somehow. They apparently no longer support or fix my model of printer. So I'm forced to buy a new printer, The customer service rep transfers me to another HP rep to buy a printer & was quoted $69.99 for a particular model. So the rep ends up being in the USA & I was clear that I live in Canada. Well this means the quoted price is obviously wrong but I was quoted a price I expected to pay that price. Long story short I was given a quote & it was not honored. I was transferred 10 times & given the runaround by 11 people. Worst experience in customer service I ever had! Edit: After checking my bank statement I have been charged twice for the printer I had to buy to repkace my older one. I have brought this to attention to the company & they still have not issued the money back to my accout. Ivhave spoken with escalation team & still no resolution. BEWARE DO NOT BUY HP products!!! This company is a thieving & lying establishment!!!"
304,"I installed three HP 972x color ink cartridges (C/M/Y) for use in my MFP 577dw printer.  These were original / genuine HP large capacity cartridges.  I always buy a set for spares when I install a new set.  When I installed the cartridges, the Yellow was accepted, but the Cyan and Magenta cartridges errored saying that they were too old.  NOTE: these were purchased at the same time as the Yellow cartridge. I contacted HP and gave them screen shots of the printer status and showed that the printer was fine by reinstalling the old cartridges.  They would not replace the faulty ink cartridges nor tell me how to override the error without a receipt.  I explained that the cartridges had been purchased several months in the past and I did not have the receipt.  I sent pictures of the cartridges and showed that they were genuine and new.  HP didn't care.  These cartridges are $147 each, which I view as what HP stole from me by not standing behind their products.HP Case Number: 5097768096"
305,"I bought a hp laptop a few months ago. The delivery was incredibly poor, they told me very little information about when the laptop was arriving, then one day I get a message saying that it would arrive that day between certain times (no one would be in to get) I then tried to get them to deliver it to a neighbour, instead of that they took it to the post office. In terms of the laptop itself, I do like it, it runs well. However I have had a few issues with it. Sometimes it just restarts on its own, it does not hold charge as well as stated as it will only be high on battery for 2 hours tops. My main issue was with the lack of information from HP, the laptop is not bad, but I do not think it is worth the money I paid for it. I am a bit disappointed."
306,"Adaptor and track pad not working in new omen series bought few days ago , no one turning up for repairs case I'd -5097434745"
307,"I was having issues with my HP Desktop so subscribed to the HP Care Smart Friend for £10 a month, on their site, where you can get 24/7 help with your machine. This isn't even the case and very deceptive marketing. I tried to unsubscribe and get a refund two days after I'd subscribed using the HP phone number, in their email, only to encounter an automated message stating, 'Due to unforeseen circumstances we are not able to service your call. try again later.'. The virtual assistant, they have on the site and over the phone, is useless. No real live agents to be found. The Whatapps customer service is also shockingly bad with rude condescending agents refusing to empathise and assist. Ringing HP is a bigger hassle and waste of time with the agents transferring me to different departments and locations, unable and unwilling to help with my request. All I wanted was a simple refund and to unsubscribe from their HP Smart Friend but HP seem intent on making their customers' lives a misery by complicating this process. It's now two weeks and despite sending emails and letters in the post I haven't received a response from HP with their line still playing the automated message. I've cntacted Citizen's Advice and will contact Trading Standards to help me resolve this matter as HP could be taking money out of my account each month for nothing, essentially robbing me for a service that doesn't exist and I no longer want! They have shown me they have no regard for their patrons. If i could I would give them no stars! Their unprofessional. Their sites are awkward to navigate through, and send you in a circle with no live agents to be found only the virtual assistant, which doesn't help. Due to this matter I will not be purchasing anything from HP in future and urge everyone else to steer clear of them."
308,"Called HP support for assistance troubleshooting an issue I am having with my printer.  I was transferred twice before getting to someone that could help me.  In the end, I was told they could not support me with this model LaserJet 200 colorMFP M275nw although they are the manufacturer because they no longer offer support.  My only option was to pay $19 for support but there was no promise they could assist me.  My printer is connected fine, rarely used, purchased brand new, it says it's connected to my Mac, however, when attempting to print, error message is stuck on ""printer is not responding"".  NEVER PURCHASE AN HP PRODUCT EVER!"
309,"Where do I start? I bought a laptop online November 30th, 2022. The package was hand delivered by our local FedEx driver who pointed out that the package had clearly gone through extensive water damage on the way and recommended that I refuse the package because it was a laptop (he even let me open it and there was no protection from water whatsoever). I sent it back and contacted HP a couple days later. They issued an exchange after I finally got the message of what happened through and that I did not have the laptop, I had sent it back because it was water damaged. They called two days later stating that they could not locate my package to resend it??? Hello, it’s DAMAGED. Then after explaining the story for the 10th or 11th time, an agent finally understood that I needed an EXCHANGE not a RETURN. They were in the middle of transferring me to a manager and the call ended…. (Beyond pissed lol). Called them back, explained my story AGAIN. Got to a manager finally for an exchange and I was on hold for 45 minutes with the manager while she was processing my exchange. She then sent me an email with return labels for the laptop I do not currently have because I refused the damaged laptop that was already sent back to their facility (face palm). Jesus Christ. Hopefully the new laptop comes in great condition so I don’t have to deal with this crap again. It’s been almost a month, I would have been better off spending a few extra hundred going to a Best Buy.."
310,"As I prepare to buy myself a new laptop, I want to reflect on the utterly useless piece of hot garbage that my old HP Pavillion 14-ce3xxx laptop was. Flimsy, average for about the first year of use before slowing down, and plagued with more thermal issues than 21st century planet earth. It's difficult to get inside with screws hidden under foot pads, and flimsy plastic braces and a plastic case that fractures easily in order to void the warranty and discourage users from doing their own laptop maintainence to give more money to hp for repairs. The fans sound like an open door to hell and run ridiculously loud when doing simple tasks like opening a browser or running Discord. The thermal paste wore away after a year and a half, and given the user has to open the laptop to replace it, this is another fun planned obsolesce feature that hp has delightfully engineered into their product.Long story short: Don't buy HP, their laptops are cheaply made, are plagued with thermal issues, and will turn slow and useless after a year of use. Garbage company 1/10."
311,"I went onto there site to purchase a laptop/gave my card details and purchased a pc. 30 days later .text came Klarna to make payment.  I DID NOT ASK FOR CREDIT I DONT NEED IT. YOU DO NOT GET A INVOICE WITH A LINK TO PAY NOTHING.THATS A SCAM TO GET FOLK INTO DEBT.  YOU GO TO PAY THE HASSELL IT TAKES IS UNBALIVABLE..PHONE THIS KLAMA INSTITUATE UP' GUESS WHAT ...THEY CAN NOT TAKE PAYMENTS OVER THE PHONE..I NEVER GAVE MY AUTHORITY TO PLACE ITEAMS ON CREDIT,"
312,The agent name Amy that  I spoke to kept laughing when I told her my ink was printing with gaps after trying her trouble shooting issues. She told me to do a hard reset and then my printer wouldn’t work at all. I end up getting it to work after my own trouble shooting yet my ink still was still printing with gaps. She kept laughing at my issue. When I asked what’s so funny she said it’s her mannerism. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she stopped talking and ignored me. I kept asking and she never responded. After 2 minutes I hung up and still had the issue.
313,"incredibly slow poor service , sent in a gaming laptop for repairs under warranty and it came back more broken , they then offered a downgrade as a replacement"
314,Following a recent loss of sound on my HP laptop I contacted the helpline and there followed many hours over several days of direct contact real time support by WhatsApp and phone including help with using all the available built in and downloadable problem solving software. The problem was that the inbuilt speaker and microphone could not be detected by the system. Eventually they had to give up having run out of ideas and as my laptop was out of warranty the final options offered were to go through a paid service or attempt a full reset at home. When I requested contact details for an HP service centre they just said I could check online for any stockist but did mention Currys by name. I took my machine the tech counter at Currys In Tottenham and after queuing for around 20 minutes I handed it over expecting to leave it for investigation and an estimate. The technician took my details and connected my laptop to the Currys system and ran through a few processes and then came the ‘Eureka’ moment when he suddenly said “That’s the quickest repair I’ve ever made!” - and sure enough after running a few more tests of the sound system the patient was discharged back into my care fully restored to health……..with no charge.I must add that the HP advisors did try their best to sort the problem and the previous support zI have had from them for our 2 laptops 1 desktop pc and 1 printer scanner has been excellent.
315,Too worst people they are Nobody responded me from 48 hours and I was dieing to ractify my laptop.Too worst customer experience
316,"My company bought the printer ( LaserJet Pro M404dw) from HP. But the printer was faulty one. HP agreed to change with the new one for the faulty printer. They gave me the collection date for 13 of December with the Parcel Force. The Parcel Force never sent the label to me but they came and collected in 13 of December without Label. The Parcel Force took that faulty printer.  When I asked to Sarah (from HP who is dealing this case) at 12 of December about the label via email, but she didn't answer. The Parcel Force came and  took the faulty printer but the HP keep asking me about the tracking number which they never sent to me. We are very Loyal customer for HP printer. If they cannot fix this case, we won't use HP printer anymore in my company as they are breaking the trust of my company and not taking responsibilities for what they handling. Now they said Sarah is not working in the HP company anymore and Mike is dealing this case.  I hope they can fix for us very soon."
317,"Bought a HP Pavillion 15T laptop. The Pavillion model had a significant discount for the holiday shopping season. Had to add a couple custom options such as a backlit keyboard so it took longer to get. Let me say, looks can be deceiving as I thought the Pavillion lineup was a mid- range quality laptop. I was disappointed in its flimsy plastic chassis, cheap keyboard, dim display and short battery life. I ended up returning the laptop for a refund. I guess anymore if you don't buy top tier models you can expect many compromises in quality."
318,Pure incompetence by HP advisor on the phone. Wouldn't believe anything I said when I told the parcel was lost as I had been informed by Parcelforce (and parcelforce not helping by logging it as an address issue rather than saying item was not on van and then lost in depot). What's the point of HPs customer service interface if they are not able (or unwilling) to do anything to sort out the issue. Complete waste of time.
319,"Spoke to Stana in HP today, disgusted by the poor level of service. The advisor was very arrogant and refused to log a complaint, when informed I can escalate to the FOS she instead argued there was no basis for a complaint and would log a EOD to herself. Absolutely stunned at the incompetent service. Very surprised HP employees such people. I spent half an hour arguing that I can submit a complaint as a consumer which I am sure would not be logged judging by the tone of the staff."
320,If I could put one I would. Terrible experience from every angle terrible service. I wouldn’t recommend them .
321,"I'm a corporate customer. Had several mobile workstations that had internal batteries fail. Was given a run around about getting the ticket opened. Once we had the correct diagnostic code we were given another run around getting service. I personally set up a time for the technician to meet and service, just to find out he was in the wrong service area and wouldn't show. I never want to see the HP logo on any device my company will purchase. My company will never purchase an HP device because of this. I just canceled an order for several HP Omen's and will look elsewhere."
322,"I bought an HP laptop in May 2021, and for the last 19 months it has not been working properly. Windows Explorer keeps crashing every few minutes, and each time it does I am unable to use the laptop for 5 minutes while I wait for it to recover.I have been trying to raise a case with HP since I bought it, and have about 6 cases all closed without any resolution. Absolutely useless customer support and the products/service is NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE in my opinion."
323,"I bought an HP ENVY 6400 series printer and finally I became so angry I destroyed it with a hammer. At best it wouldn't follow commands. I spent several hundreds of dollars on ink which I shouldn't have had to do.At worst it was truly envious, and possessed. At any rate, I will never comfortably buy another HP printer. This is sad because HP is the only printer I would have considered buying before."
324,"HP All In One 34 c1045tPoor quality control out of the boxHad this custom built, received it 19 days later. Open it and power it up and what do I see but a stuck pixel on the big beautiful screen. You would think they would have better quality control since it was Built and customized. I jumped through hoops with 4 different techs for 4 days and finally they tell me what I already know. They said they will ship me a box and return label so I can ship it back to be repaired. They also advised me it will be another couple of weeks before I get it back. So be advised they will not be a local fix. This one will probably go back.This is their reply:Mikec86, Our staff has read your review and values your contribution even though it did not meet all our website guidelines. Thanks for sharing, and we hope to publish next time! Submit something new Thanks again,HP"
325,"On this day, again my printer was not working. I called and as always they constantly apologize and yet do not provide and answer to the problem. They purposely do something on their end to prevent you from printing and then try to tell you that your printer is not working so that they can sell you another. After arguing with them for 30 minutes, my printer miraculously started working. Another time i had a contract to receive ink from them and again another problem. When I got fed up, i called to cancell and again another problem. They told me i could no longer use the ink that I paid for because no longer had a contract with them and told me I had to buy a new one from staples in order for it to work. This is their way of trying to sell you a knew printer by telling you its not working. I have never met a company who think that everyone is as stupid as they are into making you believe their lies. They purposely prevent you from using your product by doing something at their end. Nothing but a bunch of crooks and thieves. They hold you hostage and try to strong arm you into getting a contract from then which they never give you servive or fullfill their obligation in helping you solve problems. I will never buy another product from them ever again and I will never recommend them to anyone ever again. Worst service ever."
326,"The service of HP is appalling, I got a faulty laptop and they told me they would have to take it back to look at it and it will take up to 10 days to repair while leaving me without a laptop, STAY CLEAR OF HP APPALLING SERVICE AND LAPTOPS"
327,"If it was possible to give 0 i ld have, one of the most awful customer services and company approach/attitude i have experienced.I made the ultimate mistake of getting a HP printer:1. Their ink is more expensive than Mort Champagne, DROP TO DROP. What, another American Company ripping off the British charging more than they do in America! thats a surprise. How on earth can you justify ink as in paper ink that existed for centuries cost more than whisky, more than champagne, in fact more than some medicines!!!!!!!!!! I just cant get my head round this. BY the time you paid for the 4 colours, you need a loan or a grant from the gov.2. Another day light robbery tactic from the company is they monitor if you used a copy cartridge and disable your printer, how this is legal is beyond me, at times of fair competition, where we force gas companies, electrics and even broadband to open up to competition. 3. Enrolling into their expensive HP Ink packages, it works up to the limit of your package, example 50 printouts a month, if you go over they penalise you at a very high rate per page. But the worst thing is if you are on holiday or not printing you still pay. 4. Even after paying and enrolling, I had a faulty printer, they replaced after hours and hours of ""trouble shooting"". However, the printer still refuses to connect to their servers. You buy anything else you plug it works, but HP expects you to work as part of their IT on site trouble shooting team. You are there holding a camera like a fool for their overseas support to see what are you doing, while you are deleting, setting up, reseting, plugging unplugging removing webservies, reconnect webservices, delete wife, reconnect wife, rest printer, reconnect printer, unplug printer, plug printer, use the app down load the app, connect using the app, go back use ip address on website manually etc etc etc, hey wow 4 hours later i got a job for HP working for free to fix their software/hardware that should have come working out of the box. Giving up on this, i got some private cartridges from HP not as part of the program, that worked initially but as one of the coloured cartridges ran out, the printer stopped printing even though my black one is 70% full. another scam, force you to buy coloured cartridge, when i only want to print black and white. And all of this and they still charging me monthly fee for the ink printing service that they cant provide and when i spoke to the agent i was told this is their policy to charge monthly regardless of wheter i can or can not print. Can this be any more worse service bordering on illegal!"
328,"Avoid this sh** company Ordered laptop, they sent wrong one 3x cheaper. Does not answer e mails. Does not want to refund  money. Avoid. Avoid avoid!!!!"
329,"HP printers are some of the best around in terms of product features and performance however, you need to know you will spend the rest of the printer's life being forced to buy only HP genuine ink at extortionate prices.  HP have pushed out firmware updates over the last few years and these updates have enforced cartridge protection which means that if you try to install any 'compatible' cartridge you will get a message telling you that it is not a genuine HP cartridge and that the firmware has blocked it to 'Protect You'! There are articles on how to change settings in options but I can tell you that these no longer work.  I have an HP OfficeJetPro 8710 and it is a good printer, but as a set of colour and black inks from HP now cost almost as much as a new printer, such as the Brother MFC-J4540DW, then the choice is obvious.  If you contact HP (UK) they will waffle on about their ink use programmes that mean you only pay for what you print - funny but that's the same with any cartridge as I only use it to print? In essence HP are holding their customers to ransom and this has now been recognised in several countries in Europe and in the US, where HP are having to pay a lot on money in compensation to customers - but it is not the case in the UK where they are being let to get away with this shameful practice.  I hear they are seeing the issue affect their global sales and I am not surprised as I have just thrown my fully functioning HP 8710 printer in the recycling bin at the local dump rather than pay £181 to HP for a set of replacement ink cartridges (The Brother MFP printer noted above comes with a full set of inks and is now £189 at Amazon UK).  I will not use HP again."
330,"I can't believe I have both HP Pavilion and HP printer and they both suck, I should have gotten a hint from the low prices. I genuinely wish this brand would go bankrupt, their products are the worse!"
331,"How can I explain?. I tried to contact hp support, I am glad they are not supporting my trousers otherwise I would be in trouble. Changed passwords, do this do that DONT talk to anyone though even when you do they cut you off and don't bother to call back. All I want is my printer to print dark enough so I can read it.No wonder they promise to supply you with FREE INK !!!!"
332,"I’m not shore why the reviews are bad for HP printers I’ve got 2 and both are really good . The software is free so not shore aswell why people are paying for it iv got windows and Apple both are free , instant ink is good you pick the amount you print and pay a small amount for inks other then a little slow on the sending I’ve not really had a problem. Link to get 3 months free ink extra if you want it add the code in the box rwnfsb at the end of setup"
333,"Worst Service and Support. 1)  New Case for each call or chat for same issue , makes it confusing. 2) Case dashboard does not show what was discussed. 3) Never share transcripts of discussion ( sales and support both) 4) Reaching support is a big pain , tele support keep a bell ringing in the background and HP not been able to fix it for more than 45 days 5) Simple OS Issue is not resolved for more than 40 days !!! IF YOU WANT TO PAY MONEY TO BUY PAIN SCREW UP YOUR OWN HAPPINESS   PLEASE BUY FROM HP"
334,"Do not buy HP envoy 5032 printer/copy machine. It is too costly to constantly replacing the ink cartridge. Most of the HP ink cartridges are not full. Despite several conversation with the Customer Service Team, I have had a very unsatisfactory resolution."
335,"We made the biggest mistake ever when we purchased a printer from HP a year ago.  It is the HP Envy Pro 6400 for home office use.  You are required to download an app to use it, and supposedly it's as easy as pie to use all functionalities via this app.  Don't believe it!  We have to sign into the app every time  you want to print something and half the time, it doesn't recognise your credentials never mind the task you are hoping for it to do!  If you're successful in logging in, and you try do something simple like 'copy' a document, it then tells you this functionality is not available!  When you go through the entire set up again, this time including the printer name (which is already showing!) and you press copy, it then switches to your phone camera and takes a photo of whatever your phone happens to be seeing at the time and offers to print that for you! I don't have enough space to write about all the other functionalities like scan and send, photo print, print documents, camera scan because now my app apparently now doesn't have the drivers for any of these functions!  And I have no idea how to get them on my phone without reading through pages and pages of ""support"" documents!  I've lost the will to live and all I have energy for is to dump this printer and go buy something that might just work as expected, when you switch it on!  If you value your sanity, avoid at all costs!"
336,"If I could give a 0, I would. I've always trusted HP and their products but I will never buy anything more from them. I tend to be proactive, so I buy and store toner cartridges so that when I need them, I have them.  In 2020 I ordered a 4 pack of toner for my HP Laser Jet Pro 477 printer (410).  I received them and put them away.  Unfortunately, I did not check them.  Recently, in the middle of a large personal project, I changed the color cartridges and all was well until I was going to change the black.  They had sent the wrong cartridge, 48A ($54.99) instead ofthe 410x as ordered ($171.00)They refused to accept an exchange, return or refund because I past the ""Return date"", even though it was THEIR handling and shippjng error.They are NOT a reputable compan!  Buy from anyone else!!!Angry and disgusted"
337,"Printers are shambolic!Subscription is a con!Right now, I feel like getting a sledge hammer and crushing this piece of “rubbish” to pieces. More valuable as crap plastic!"
338,Customer service automation gone bananas ! You cannot speak to an agent for love nor money....customer service is a joke...and the irony is that I wanted to buy more of their products! Errrr NO!
339,"Sent a brand new (3 months old) probook laptop for repair as the screen bezel was loose.  The laptop was in absolute pristine condition as we always look after our stuff.  The service centre argue that it's accidental damage, this is absolute rubbish.  The bezel is coming loose and I suspect it's the glue seal that has failed.  Wouldn't buy HP or trust them in future.  I knew it was a gamble switching from Lenovo who have always been brilliant with our IT needs and support/repairs."
340,Used to be maybe perhaps 3 stars ? Ages ago. Went down a lot after that. Now it's a bottom. Quality is horrible. Lifespan of products short. Prices very high. Not impressed at all looking at prices and status. Not one i will buy again.
341,HP have a new way to enrol you without your consent in a scheme which does not allow you to use alternative ink cartridges. A 'Which' report pointed out the ink was twice as expensive but no difference in quality.If you buy a printer with an 'e' suffix you will find you've been enrolled to HP PLus scheme. DO NOT BUY THEIR PRINTERS.
342,"I  had to pay $ 79.00 for hp smart app for my PC, I  thought when you buy your printer you got the drivers free. I went 123.hp.com and all that did was try to sell a driver updater for $9.99/month. Then when I  went to hp support and $79.00 later I  had the  app not very impressed hp!!. After reading other reviews on hp printers I  wish that I  had never brought  it I am now wondering how many other people have charged $ 79.00 BY JUST ANSWER to get something that should be free?."
343,The 2&1/2 hours on the phone with tech support we tried 8 different ways to reconnect my 4155 deskjet printer and nothing. then April stated I need to contact my internet provider ( why nothing is wrong with my account)and she will call me back today Sun ( she never did)and never gave me a reference number!This printer is only 5 months old and not working. we lost power and it willnot reconnect at all.To top it off I called back today ask for a supervisor he told me he can help I need a computer or laptop I told him I never used it before with my printers so I need it with my phone he stated he couldn't help me!! I WILL NEVER EVER EVER BUY ANOTHER HP PRINTER THIS WAS MY SECOND ONE IN ONE YEAR!
344,"I bought a Pavilion laptop and care pack, then ordered a case and wireless mouse. I have tried to cancel both orders without success. I received the laptop but HP refuse to reply to my request to return it and refund. I have not received the other goods but HP have deducted all of the money from my PayPal account anyway. I cannot contact them directly and they are simply ignoring emails."
345,I HAVE A PAVILION X360-53TX. WITHIN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF THE PURCHASE THE HINGE SUPPORTING THE SCREEN BROKE. THE LAPTOP WAS NOT EVEN DROPPED OR ANYTHING. ITS JUST THE THE PARTS OF HP PRODUCTS ARE SO POORLY BUILT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GO THROUGH NIRMAL WEAR AND TEAR. I WOULD RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO LOOK OUT FOR DELL OR LENOVO PRODUCTS AS THEY ARE MUCH MORE RELIABLE. MY LAPTOP COMES WITH A 16GIGS OPTANE MEMORY AND 932GIGS HDD. THE LAPTOP IS SO SLOW I CANNOT EVEN EXPLAIN AND I WILL HAVE TO UPGRADE TO AN SSD EVEN AFTER PAYING SUCH A HEFTY AMOUNT. THIS LAPTOP COSTED ME ABOUT 72000 AND RECENTLY I PURCHASED A LENOVO SLIM 3 WORTH 38000 WHICH ABSOLUTELY WORKS WAY BETTER THAN THIS DUMP OF A LAPTOP. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT TRUST HP WITH THE BUILD QUALITY AND EVERYTHING.
346,"I bought Laptop from HP website. Laptop is good and no issue. When I received it, the charger was missing.I called customer service and explain the situation, customer service has only one option available to process the refund instead of sending me the charger. The turnaround time of product return, and reissue new laptop is more than a month. I asked them why not just send me a charger that was missing. The reply was this is the only option we have. I am not sure is this the right practice from HP?"
347,It’s a real shame because this company were excellent previously. I bought a new desk jet and it’s been useless alongside the pressurised ink subscription they now run and the non-existent customer service 3hours without a fix. I won’t be going anywhere near this company again.
348,"HP “Smart” is by far the worst printing experience in 25+ years. Avoid at all costs.HP have taken a basic capability “printing from a laptop” and made it unreliable, slow and frustrating. It requires a windows app to allow the printer to even respond but even then the print queue will often fail or fail part way through. The additional insult is that with “pay per page” ink subscription you will be charged for each part finished print job.Have reached out to HP tech support and reconfigured the printer a number of times but it continues to be disfunctional . The HP smart devices are effectively land fill, avoid at all costs."
349,"It took several calls to find a solution but todays call with a tech named Emerson in El Salvador ws spectacular...she was super courteous, extremely talented and focused right in on the problem and fixed it in about 15 minutes...prior calls were up to 5 hours with no solution found..glad i perservered and met Emerson she was the best thank you HP"
350,"Very disappointed with HP instant ink and the service - Significantly overcharged with no notifications to advise or encourage me to change my plan. Due to the poor service and lack of being able to contact anyone (apart from a digital assistant), I am now told I can't use my printer with the ink that I have already paid for. I think this service is a rip off. I have given you my business and because I don't subscribe to your monthly plans, I can't use the ink I've purchased from you. I am looking to leave HP on this poor experience."
351,"purchased a brand new hi spec gaming laptop which is showing battery as faulty, customer service talked me through some tests which show batteries to be faulty they then ask me to charge to capacity and then completely discharge batteries over three days tom calibrate and it still doesn't work, they then suggest I send the laptop to one of their service centres who will test it over two weeks. errr no instead lets return your peice of junk and you can do a refund"
352,This company should be out of business  selling a printer that  gives nothing but trouble.Even with updates it is a complete piece of junk.Never again !
353,Bought a computer monitor from HP store on Black Friday. Received the unit and it appeared to work but I discovered that the buttons controlling the brightness and on screen display didn’t work. I called tech support and spent 2 hours convincing them the unit was defective. They said I could send the unit in for warranty repair and after they received the unit they would send a refurbished unit. I told them that didn’t seem fair. They said since it was less than 30 days old I could return it for and exchange. I sent the unit back and now got charged 60% more because the exchange unit is no longer considered  Black Friday deal. Plus I will not receive the replacement until next year.
354,This company is falling apart. I have a printer that stops printing every couple of days. Their systems suck!!!!!!  Buy any other printer in the universe!
355,NEVER BUY AN HP PRINTER AS IT IS WITH INK SUBSCRIPTION. IT'S LIKE PAY AS YOU GO. EVEN IF YOU STILL HAVE INK AND A SPARE ONE IF YOU STOP YOUR SUBSCRIPTION THE PRINTER WILL NOT WORK!!!. WORST PRINTER I EVER BOUGHT. SO SLOW AND ALWAYS NEED TO TURN ON AND OFF TO WORK. WHAT A CRAP PRODUCT!
356,"terrible - there is zero customer service. my brilliant printer prints big documents backwards, so you have to reorder the pages yourself. all you can ask is the virtual assistant which is utterly useless. my brother printer never did this."
357,Excellent customer service. HP Laptop and Printer. Quality products with lots of offers such as instant ink subscriptions. I’ve got a 18 month instant ink subscription. No more having to purchase ink for the next 18 months both colour and black cartridges typically cost over £100. They know when you’re about to run out and ship new HP cartridges and you just send the old ones back for recycling.
358,WISH I HAD NEVER BROUGHT THIS HP SMART PRINTER. The printer only works from the app and 3 hours later I am still not able to reconnect it to my laptop. It's like ground hog day sending me to my phone app around and around getting nowhere. Save you self the bother buy another make of printer.
359,GREAT EXPERIENCE! HP actually pulled through with their warranty and despite a little delay they actually honoured they and did not blame the customer. They replaced my OMEN which was still under warranty and for the most part everything went smoothly. I come from dealing with ASUS warranty in the past which was a nightmare and a bunch of crooks who blame the customer and you're helpless. in contrast my first dealings with HP warranty went really well
360,Long time fan but something has changed. I just bought a new spectre and long story short they cannot send me a valid invoice for the purchase (a business purchase) after two weeks of contacting them on all possible support channels. If anything goes wrong with the new machine I guess I would be totally SOL at this point. Gave them a chance now to see but will not buy an HP again.
361,I have been a fan of HP in the past but no more.I bought an HP Envy laptop and Printer in the last year and wish I hadn't bothered. I feel the product quality is now very inferior and the printer is a joke I have hardly used it and it keeps asking for a subscription for print cartridges that don't last very long??? I am sure these printers are being managed remotely to increase revenue for HP.Now I have got to look for another printer maybe a 2nd hand on that is not linked online and never prints when you want it to. If you are looking for more tech give HP a wide berth
362,"HP’s Cyber Monday is just a big BAIT AND SWITCH operation. I tried on at least 5 occasions to configure a desktop machine and each time I could not complete a sale from their website. Finally at 11:00 pm EST 11/28/2022 I called customer service and configured it with Leonard. Ultimately we got the machine configured and mysteriously the price went up over $100 over what it configured from the on site store. Leonard advised me around 11:30 that the Cyber Monday pricing was no longer in effect despite it still being Monday. When I received the order confirmation it was dated 11/29/2022 despite the fact that it was still 11/28 (my birthday, thanks)"
363,"Hp Instant Ink is a scam. Cartriges already dried up, but no new ones were shipped. Printer stopped working at all after, but I still have to pay two subscriptions."
364,"I should preface that I have always been happy with the HP products that I have purchased. However, I recently went online to order laser jet toner based on the constant pop ups from HP about low toner ink.  I accidentally ordered CF17 instead of 17A and when I went to return it was the most ridiculous experience and I can assure I will NEVER order anything on line from HP again. Their Customer Service is a misnomer. They read from a script ask the same questions repeatedly and when you ask for a supervisor they put you on hold to speak to someone in a non existant back room. They are not working from an office, they work from home and if you need to speak to a senior person ........ good luck.  It is beyond frustrating and all they do is offer you the same inane useless suggestions with no help at all.  I will buy from a brick and mortar store and if I make a mistake they will gladly do an exchange. If and when you finally get in touch with someone that offers a refund or exchange don't count on actually getting it without endless hours of aggrevation. Welcome to HP customer service, how can we royally    annoy you."
365,"I am printer user and printing is my regular schedule. But this company makes me pull my hair! They keep sending me broken/faulty printer which always have some hardware issue! I have like already 5th and it has problem with motherboard, it shows error code on blue screen, nothing works I am so mad about this. Please for god sake do not purchase anything from this cr-ppy company because you will regret it just like i do!!! They are very very bad and poor quality company!!"
366,"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. KEEP TELLING ME THEY REFUNDED ME BUT ITS BEEN OVER 45 DAYS AND I AM TIRED OF SENDING THEM EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS, TO SPEAK TO THEIR UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF WHO HAS NO CLUE WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOR INTERESTED IN LOOKING DEEPER INTO THE ISSUE. TELLING ME ON PHONE THERE IS PROBLEM WITH MY BANK. WHY ON EARTH A BANK WOULD REFUSE A REFUND. WILL BE CONTACTING CONSUMER COURT SHORTLY."
367,"Having bought a new printer I called their help line for assistance only to be met with the most disgusting customer service ever. It merely amounted to an attempt to extort money for a firewall which was not required, My son set the printer up for me in less than 10minutes.I will never buy another product from this company in my life.All th I s because they employ useless, unhelpful staff with an atfitude."
368,"Very Bad CS. Difficult to reach. Asked to hold the line and wait but disconnected - this happened several times. I have a global warranty laptop brought out of UK. The battery is dead and needs replacement. They refuse to handle said because it was not purchased in UK, and they do not have spare parts. Then what's the meaning of a global warranty, and why cannot book spare parts? I had a similar situation with ASUS, and they immediately collected the laptop and booked parts from US to fix it."
369,"I have never in 30 years of working on laptops and being involved in I.T. come across a worse manufacturer than HP.It took me well over 12 hours to rid MY laptop of their bloatware and spyware, they had even installed a keylogger so they could see my every key press and track pad movement. The amount of data they get sent back to their HQ is unreal. I also had several hours of uninstalling W11 crap but that's another story.Getting rid of the trial versions of programs was even worse and not even the McAfee removal tool was able to remove the trial version of this insidious program. I had to resort to removing it manually using regedit, not something that I would recommend for beginners.My opinion as a professional in this field is to avoid their company at all costs."
370,"I got a new laptop from HP which has all the features I wanted. However, within 4-5 months there was a touch pad issue. I contacted HP regarding the same and they kept telling me to perform factory rest and download updates to solve the issue for 6 months till my warranty with HP was expired. I did not understand what was the actual issue and nor it was solved. I expected more from HP. Bad experience."
371,"If I could I wouldn’t even give a start. Really bad customer service. To the point you order something that’s wrong the order gets canceled and you never get a refund. They are thieves, company designed to steal money. Drain on society. Should be shut down for fraud."
372,Wish I had never purchase that heap of junk. Perhaps used the printer two to three times over the course of a few weeks before throwing it away before throwing it through a wall.
373,I should have known not to buy an HP printer after buying an HP laptop years ago that I’ve literally only used about 5 times because it’s a total piece of junk.   Bought printer 3772 & good luck getting it to work.  Already out of ink after printing 7 pages of straight text.   Tried to enroll in the ink club & can’t because the app doesn’t talk to the printer.  No surprise there.   Tried to get customer service help & you have to pay them to answer a question on how to enroll & spend money on a piece of junk that you already spent money on.   What a bunch of crooks with worthless products!
374,"Ordered ink via the hp store, it didn't arrive, tracker advised address details missing (turned out to be the house number). Took me 3 days to get through to anyone, they said they would update the address. Another week, nothing, I call again and they claim it has been delivered but that they will send a replacement. A week later, not arrived. I call the customer service team who confirm that the same thing has happened, they haven't given the full address to the delivery company. Asked for refund which hopefully is being processed. This is the most chaotic and incompetent company I've ever dealt with."
375,No phone support if your printer is out of warranty
376,"Since HP have introduced anti-competitive restrictions on printer ink cartridges, they now expect me to spend more on ink than a new printer would cost. Their website also makes it impossible to contact anyone to even discuss the issue."
377,I bought an HP desktop less than 4 months ago and it will not reboot or start after an HP update. All hardware checks out but software will not work or start. Customer service has stated at first the computer was out of warranty. Then I proved I just purchased the computer they stated the warranty doesn't cover software. They were very rude and condescending. She offered to help to help for a $149.00 fee.
378,"I bought a brand new HP Pavilion Laptop, this was approximately 15 years ago.   It was one of the first laptops that they put an i7 chip in.    I have had this laptop ever since sitting in the spare room and it hasn’t worked for 13 of the 15 years.   I saw it today again and it just makes my blood boil.When they first used the i7 chip they didn’t account for the heat it would produce so it spent a lot of time in the repair shop even during the time I was using it.   It would constantly overheat.I have written and written and written to HP and they refuse to do anything about it.   Even before the warranty ran out, they would tell me to send it to the repair shop each time but as soon as the warranty ran out they didn’t want to know.   The laptop cost $1700 + so it was the top of the range for that type of laptop even then but it has sat for all these years as a useless piece of equipment.I would not use HP again for anything if it were the last company on the planet.    Beware, their customer service is atrocious."
379,I bought a laptop for my daughter for university  it went wrong just over tge 30 day .sent back 27th September  have had nothing but bs excuses from them as to why It hasn't been  returned  they told me to wait yet another week  whilst they come up with another excuse refusing to refund refusing to give me a new computor I will never buy from HP store  again  very shady09.12.22Still waiting for a new computer  promised call backs never happen can't be put through to a manager this company is a joke
380,"These people are actively targeting disabled veterans and first responders, then send out broken equipment, then make you fight for weeks to get a return or fair treatment, they call you on the phone and verbally harass you during this process"
381,"Ordered Omen 16 with Care Pack in OctoberStarted noticing faults after 3 days, and requested replacement.Still have to follow up HP myself almost a month on, has not gone anywhere.Ive called, sent Emails, Whatsapp. They've asked for the same documents over and over then have to send the same document again the following week.Will not buy from HP again."
382,"Printer set up for Deskjet 4130e failed. The printer came with a lot of paper booklets but only covered unpacking. The chatbot on the HP website does not accept printer set up as a topic for help.Technical support once I found a phone number [not with the printer] was aware of many problems setting up the printer using 123.hp.com. In my case the set up procedure froze after insert paper.The technical support person was excellent, it took over 30 minutes to complete the printer set up procedure.HP.com and 123.hp.com are not worth one star.The support person was worth 5 stars"
383,"I bought a new laptop in September but it reboots while I am using it and I get boot disk errors.  Contacted HP via WhatsApp and after several hours someone responded. Over the course of a few days the agent got me to run some checks and then told me it's ok.  Well, clearly it isn't!!  Who wants a laptop with errors, especially after paying for a 3 year CarePac.  Tried contacting customer service again via WhatsApp and the agent just stopped responding before we even got anywhere.  There is no phone number to call and the so-called callback system doesn't work either.  I would like my money back but there is no way of contacting HP.  It's an absolute shambles and a disgrace."
384,Your incompetent and dishonest member of my staff lacked the ability to get my HP printer working with my Windows 11 computer.This operative knowingly damaged my default printer an Epson 860. She destroyed the printer files deliberately and was TOLD to leave it alone. She is an untrustworthy individual who cost me £60.00 to get my Epson printer working after 2 hours reloading everything back on again.Case Number 5094855153: Your Case has been Created CRM:0078988000571Train your staff to listen and NEVER disrupt customers other printers deliberately.
385,"Unable to Find Customer SupportI recently broke my printer, and I wanted to find support regarding how to fix the issue. Unfortunately, no calls or email support is available. Because of my expired warranty plan, I can only use the ""community support"" option, which does nothing. There is no option for one-time support. I can't even call or email. The customer support system makes me hesitate to get their product or subscription again :("
386,The worst PCs ever. I would give it a 0 star if I could. My Excel is regularly defunct and it's just a terrible brand in general - this company should be audited for overcharge.

390,"Horrible company HP and customer service unresponsive. Laptop not working. Don't buy a laptop from HP during Black Friday, they mess with the prices. People think they get a lot of discount. Pavallion was 799 GBP a week ago. Right now they are advertising that the laptop was 970 GBP in the past. Misleading prices."
391,"I bought a microphone from them online.Mo serial number on the box.No invoice sent.It is a hypex quadcast 100 pounds .I have been through an endless stream in the last week of phone calls to customer service phone calls to technical support none of them can do anything to help me the microphone doesn’t work and I’m stuck with it it’s £100 down the drain my next way forward is to contact my credit card and explain that it’s been some sort of a dupe.They do not reply to emails.DON,T BUY ANTHING FROM THEM. ANYTHING !!!"
392,"It is easier to fly a rocket to the moon than use HP printers. Suggest the programme writers are instructed to write programmes that end users can use rather than for their own vanity. I've used them for years, today I'm off to buy another brand and current printer is only 12 months old but trouble every day I've tried to use it."
393,"I bought the HP Deskjet 2752e and signed up for the instant ink. The thing that is driving me nuts is this printer! It is not easy to use, is very slow and I can't change the settings or preferences, nor can I get help from support. I highly advise anyone to steer clear of this printer. It's been a nightmare."
394,Shocking customer services I have 3 x hp laptops so a good Hp customer (had problems with deliveries in the past)  This time order was delayed by 5 days and on chasing was told no longer in stock and now offering a refund. I am online chatting to Sahin from Customer services explained to him I have just put 2 of the exact same laptops in my basket so must be in stock !! I explained didnt want a refund as I have put against last quater Vat returns and asked why the one I want is still showing online (now have x 2 in basket) I asked can you please offer me an alternative laptop or can I speak to a manager he actually put the phone down!!
395,"Absolute rubbish service support their web service in some cases the pages don't work, there is no way of actually contacting them by email or phone. I have a Laptop and the screen started flickering I sent it back under warranty but months later the problem reoccurred never again would I buy from this company"
396,"Scanning a document used to take seconds... not with HP. The cretins at HP want your address, email, password, marketing preferences, subscriptions etc just to use a device you paid for and is physically next to you!"
397,I purchased a brand new all in one desktop a few weeks ago. After a couple of days it had blown. Won't power on. I contacted HP immediately and they agreed to provide a replacement following return of the item. I have been waiting two weeks now for the returns label to be provided. Every time I call I get the same nonsense. Every email I send is completely ignored. Customer service is absolutely appalling. I will never purchase any HP products again after this experience.
398,Bought a hp omen 27i moniotr a week ago. The rgb lighting on the monitor is the main issue. Everytime my laptop goes into sleep mode restarts or gets shut down. Upon start up monitor goes into default settings again the bottom desk light is bright as hell so no matter what I have to go into the settings and reset them to where I want it to be. Very annoying customer support just hung up on me after a 10 minute call..completely useless thanks for waisting 40 minutes of my time. 30 minute wait 10 minute phone call.
399,I purchased hp envy 17 inch laptop i7 processor on 29 Oct 2021 from hp uk store.Laptop has been working fine till 30 Oct 2022. Laptop screen suddenly went off after lunch on 30th and customer support confirmed that mother board is gone.Note: I don’t  recommend to buy Hp envy laptop. Please spend your 1000£ pounds on a different product.
400,"Hands up, I was conned. I just never thought it would be by such a major company. 1. I bought the house envy 6030e recently and signed up to the instant ink package. 2. Being an idiot I expected this to mean that the printer simply communicated with Hp to tell them when you needed new ink. Wrong. Did you know they charge you per page? 3. I’m not sure how a company like this can justify charging per page, they are not a local printers.  Are they paying fir the paper? No. Are they paying for the electricity? No. So on top of my monthly subscription (of 2.99 per month) they charge me an additional £98!!! 4. To clarify if I had gone to an actual printers the pages I printed would have costed around the £10 mark. On top of this my printer now won’t print which is a technology issue.This is not ethical and I’m sure I’m not the only one to complain. Customer services were useless. Even though I said I would cover the cost of whichever subscription would cover my page count if they refunded me the difference. I was told a manager would call back. Of course they didn’t.This company is fast loosing its reputation as a safe bet for printers. Very sad and very greedy"
401,"HP laptop doesn’t even deserve 1star. So pathetic. I have bought Hp laptop last year and have only used it for 5-6 times in a year and is damaged. Don’t know the reason and when i called customer care, they are saying that it’s out of warranty now. How disgusting! If i had known about this HP worst quality, i would have never bought it in the first place. I would suggest everyone that if you don’t want to waste fortune , please don’t buy HP. They are just fooling people by selling their cheap quality"
402,"I wasted 1 hour trying to connect this printer to WiFi and HP Smart, and I still haven't figured it out.. and I'm an IT director. Using a printer should be simple, but this is so infuriated me that I'm COMPELLED to leave this review. From complicated instructions to complicated apps that are trying to talk to each other and forcing you to do 99 steps just to print a page, it's RIDICULOUS."
403,Both computors suck! one of them made buzzing noises every 5 mintues and this new one I have isn't better. The wifi cuts out all of the time and then you have to restart and end up losing all of your crap! HP computors aren't great!
404,"Warranty is not being honored. They told me the replacement was already being processed. I received an email indicating that I had to show Proof of Purchase and Serial Number photos. I wrote to them indicating that I didn’t have proof of purchase and called customer service to let them know about this - they mentioned not to worry. That they understand that receipts can get lost. The order validation team contacted me and they said “serial #  is not reported to be sold to anyone and from our records is still owned by a distributor.” It seems to me that they are accusing me of stealing a monitor! It’s incredible that they said this to me so I contacted customer service and they gave me the phone number of order validation and spoke to Heyesn. Super rude and mean individual. He did not help me at all and didn’t care that HP customer service told me that. He said “ well they lied to you”. He was not helpful and when I said I wanted this to be escalated to a higher up, he said he is the highest person in the department and cannot escalate. It’s so fake! HP doesn’t want to honor a warranty that is currently active. It also does not make any sense that the warranty is currently RUNNING but not sold to anyone? It makes zero sense."
405,"The two times I attempted to use them for help installing printer software, they wanted control of my computer, then told me something was amiss with the drivers and I needed to pay them for a contract. I refused. Called Geek Squad and had no problem."
406,"Don’t Ever Buy a printer from HP , the ink is too expensive and the printers always have issues with connecting and printing"
407,"So signed up for hp instant ink last year, now for some reason I have to sign in to instant ink to even scan a document, why? Its my printer HP do one, I;m cancelling instant ink and never again buying any HP product."
408,"Last week I ordered and received a replacement toner cartridge from HP UK and fitted it only to find the prints turned out purple.  I tried to contact HP online only to find an incomprehensible long winded method of having my ONE cartridge picked up for return.  I was able to find a UK telephone number and a robot transfered me to a human in the USA who was apologetic and told me to hold the line while she transfer me back to the UK at whch point I ended the call.  I have written a complaint to several areas of HP which I imagine they will ignore as they have so many complaints but I also wrote to the CEO of HP.com whom I think everyone who has a complaint should write to as he is the one that has installed a robot that does not understand the human language.  Why should I give HP £35 for a useless piece of equipment so that they can bolster their bonuses while I have to fork out a further £35 to get what I originally ordered.  That, in my language is called stealing.  I am never going to buy from them again and I am only sorry I had not viewed these reviews before using them.  90% give one star grade.  I do not think I have ever see such a low rating for a company.  Why are they still in business!"
409,DO NOT BUY-THIS IS A SCAM- THEY OFFER FREE INK THEN WHEN YOU WANT OT USE THE PRINTER IT'D OBSOLETE WITHOUT BUYING THEIR INK -  SO REALLY YOU ARE NOT BUYING A PRINTER THAT BELONGS YOU - YOU ARE SUBSCRIBED TO INK CARTRIDGES - THEN THE PRINTER DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER IT............ IT NEVER BELONGS TO YOU..... DO NOT BUY.....DO NOT BUY.....DO NOT BUY.....DO NOT BUY.....DO NOT BUY.....
410,"Please DON'T bother with this company, who seems to rely on brand name and reputation of yesteryear.No support except for pointless virtual chat option.I contacted them 2 weeks ago and still nothing.AVOID AVOID AVOID"
411,"The HP printers are definitely not what they once have been. The new HP smart app is ridiculous and irritating, the printer never shows as online, the smart app won't let you print if you don't give your credit card data for the auto ink buying option. So basically they obligate you the PAY for printing whilst the printer is already paid.Im kicking it out again, NEVER hp again for me, and i'll NEVER advise this to ANYONE. stay far away from HP printers."
412,"I had an issue with a business laptop purchased from HP Australia, case no 5089695524.I wanted to compliment HP on the incredible customer service I received in relation to this case.There were two people that I dealt with resolving this issue, Naveen and Jon, both of them were incredibly patient, helpful and knowledgeable throughout the process.It was customer service on another level, and something that all businesses should look to emulate, surpassing all expectations.A massive thank you to both Jon and Naveen for helping get to a resolution and the amazing service along the way, I really appreciate it!It's service like this that converted me into a lifelong customer, for business and private use, awesome work."
413,How bad can it get? BAD - avoid at all costs - buy from apple is my only advice after the care centre told me that a top-end laptop ( £1800 ) bought in June 2019 is old and can’t be fixed because it’s not a factory fresh model - advised that a life expectancy of a hp laptop was 3 years! I am now working off of 2012. MacBook which is operating better than the Spector.Do you think that’s bad enough? After speaking with a care associate in July 2021 about the issue I was advised it was out of warranty - later I found this to be a fraudulent lie and it would have been covered until June of this year - as a freelancer I can’t afford to be without a laptop so waited till my annual leave to send it in for repair.The story goes on - after paying £300 for the impossible repair on such an “ old laptop “ ( June 2019 remember) NOTHING HAPPENED for days and days it took 3 hours on the phone to actually find out why the laptop hadn’t been collected on the date it was meant to be.The second day of staying at home to get it collected …. No collection - now I know what you think that’s madness and no company can expect people to stay in for weeks at a time to have a faulty laptop collected. WRONG not hp’s problem not Interested. Ok now for the fun bit where I was called a liar! I was told 1 -I didn’t buy the laptop from them so it was not their problem- an easy fix as I supplied the original invoice! 2 -  I had never spoken to anyone in July 2021 - lucky I had all the chats stored on my phone.You would think that is enough to clear anything up? ABSOLUTELY NOT. The service guy was so freaking rude and aggressive saying it’s for their problem and I can take the laptop to a third-party repair centre but they don’t make the broken part anymore so it can’t be fixed. NOT HPs PROBLEM after all it’s 3 years old … this goes against the right-to-repair laws in the UK they don’t care.
414,"MFP234SDWE Printer is showing error 49 code. I've spent 2 hours on the phone with a 'technician?' who can't offer any resolution. I was told to unplug the printer and wait for 24 hours and they would call back, but they didn't. I had to call them, and gave the operative my case number but there weren't any notes on the case files so we had to go through the whole charade again. I contacted ebuyer who I bought the printer from but they weren't interested so I've had to raise a complaint with Paypal to try to get a refund."
415,Hp envy laptop had it 11 weeks black screen motherboard gone!! So it needs to get sent off to be repaired which will be at least 7 days so as a self employed bookkeeper that's at least a week off! Cost 1500 not even worth a third of that should have gone for a mac
416,"Have a printer brought from Online few months back after two months it’s suddenly stopped I’m raise a request for service (CASE ID :BTLV465601 on 14th September 2022) they assure me the technician will come within 48hrs but technician came after one week and he bring my printer to there service Center for service still now(27th October 2022)they are not repaired my printer every time I’m contacting them they’re saying parts is ordered and not received.very pathetic service from HP,I’m waiting for two months for get my printer back still waiting.So I’m not recommend this brand for other better go for other brands like canon,Epson etc."
417,"What shocking service. Purchased a HP desktop 2022 version, had the machine less than 5 months. Machine wont switch on. Call technicians.! Hr and half wait each time at 4 days to be told, the machine needs to be backed up and collected to go back to be repaired!!!!!!!Erm HELLO how can i back up if it wont turn on?   Response was not our problem. An what happens Mr Technical support if your courier loses the package are you accepting my documents on that computer will be public property?Response was not our problem! Terrible service will never buy again"
418,"Have a printer that isn’t working due ink cartridges being ink smart. I am signed up for ink smart so paying a subscription and expect to have customer service. I have also had a error code that has been resolved with a reset, but ink smart still not working. Gone through a virtual trouble shoot.. not working. Gone through an agent assist via WhatsApp did one trouble shoot action (same as one from the virtual assist) and it still doesn’t work. Agent told me they can no longer help me as my warrantee has expired. So you still want to take my money for a flaw with you product but you don’t want to help me fix it."
419,"This review is in regards to a laptop I bought a year back now. Although the laptop I bought was brand new, it was sluggish at times and kept crashing randomly even with very few applications open. To solve and/or complain about this issue I tried contacting HP. They had an extremely poor customer service. There was no deducated customer service helpline. On their website they offered an online chat section on their website which wasn't helpful at all as I was just texting my issues to a scripted bot and not an actual person. Because I could not solve my issue using their chat section I posted my issue on a HP forum (as directed by their website). I received no response and instead weeks/months later found that my post had been deleted. Overal HP have shown disgusting customer service and provided me with an extremely poor value for money laptop that is slower than my current 2nd hand laptop!!! If you expect a reponsive, reliable customer service and a laptop/ device that should function as it should that's worth it's value, you'd be better of looking elsewhere..."
420,Bought printer from them it said I'll get it Thursday post said then it came up Friday couldn't deliver out delivery Friday  430 whent of line had look today can't find the address they post office post code is for 1 street how can they say that
421,"Their printing service is abysmal do not subscribe.The cartridges only work when your printer is connected to the internet. This requires you to keep your printer on at all times, which just isn't viable for everyone. If you don't, you'll have a real issue trying to print when you first plug it back in. At first I thought it was a poor quality printer but it's literally just the subscription service preventing you from printing.Once I ran out of ink, they never sent me a replacement, so after an infuriating chat with customer service I had to go out and buy a normal one from my local currys.Now I'm cancelling my plan directly after they charged me for the last billing cycle, they have the gall to charge me for another billing cycle."
422,"Bought hp all in one envy computer. had a fault from day 1. Had some calls with tech support and no joy. Sent it off to Flextronic their subbie, no joy, they just sent it back without attempting to fix it. Raised formal complaint -ignored. Advised we would commence small claims court procedure and a refund or buy back in hp speak was applied within a week. they then picked it up and after a few weeks got a full refund. Hp is kind of fragmented we were unable to make contact with a decision maker. It’s a pity really as I think it was just a faulty part easily fixed. It was a black hole for time"
423,"I've had the Pavilion 6 for almost 15 years, and it only stopped working now!!... and it's only the screen that's gone. The computer itself still works!"
424,Very poor service and product quality is really very poor.i had purchase 419 ink tank printer.i did not get work properly.i have raised complain for several times but they did not provide mer service even after two months.I wast my harden money.Never suggest to purchase hp products to anyone.In my previous printer I have face the same problem.Today is my last day of warrenty period I even not finished first ink tank refill ink.I have purchased 2 years of warrenty on the date of purchase.They said I have to show the bill from purchase store.How can I get bill after a year.Dont buy hp products otherwise you have to face harrasment like me.Please don't harees customer.If you can not provide services then stop.The money I have spent was not black money.Worst service hp.Never ever purchase it go for Ebson and canon.
425,"I recently encountered an issue with my stylus for my laptop. I spoke to a very kind person named Zoya (through their WhatsApp helpline). She very quickly ran me through some procedures to try and get it to work. However, no luck. She said they were going to send me a new one and it would take about 2-3 business days for it to be shipped. Here I am only 1.5 days later with my new stylus, oh, and did I mention they sent two! Not one, but two! I now have a spare!! Over all they sent me ~$150 AUD of styluses for free! I am so impressed, I didn't expect much. If you ever get someone named Zoya... You're in for some luck!"
426,"Terrible customer service for getting a refund for laptop with faulty screen.  have to deal with international call centre and can't call them directly, have to message/wait for them to call you.  Thumbs down HP."
427,"If I could rate this garbage printer AND the customer service lower than one star I would.  They don't know how to help so they require the customer to accommodate HP and the hardware.  I don't care how new the technology is I will not rearrange how the firm works to accommodate this piece of junk.  They set it up after it crapped out a week after I had it.  Then I used it for six weeks and it crapped out again.  A representative told me it was set up improperly and would continue to stop working until the firm accommodated the specialization of the tech who took the call.  Raised his voice, condescended and and was snarky to boot.  Unacceptable and ridiculous."
428,"Purchase ink cartridge but I want Extra Large, after so many emails they reply, will send postage label,Almost now one month they never send me, time is almost due for refund, did so many emails, also so many phone calls never pick the phone waiting almost 25 minutes noreply.So I decided I will send with my expense, even there is no address again I call them never replied don’t know where to send.Never buy single stuff from HP uk.Even head office never have right phones.The only thing is they will take your order quick after after that forget noCustomer services , they will pass the phone to press 1234 no reply!I would give O Stars."
429,"Pathetic customer care, it seems that they don’t care. Bought a HP victus PC worth 1.35 lakh from HP with extended warranty, product broke down in 1 month. Called customer care 28 times in 5 days & after multiple diagnostics on phone was finally assigned an engineer who told to run another diagnostic. Then was told part ordered & will be delivered in 4/5 days. No response as yet with machine still disrepaired after 6 days. Avoid buying HP"
430,"HP products are fine when they work. However in the event of a problem their tech support is less than useless. Their interventions (3 times) have only made the problem worse. An originally intermittent problem is now a ""bricked"" un bootable computer. Calls to support usually result in getting hung up on a few times before you can actually talk to someone for more than a few seconds."
431,No support for a product that was bought 4 years ago. Only paid and extended warranties. They push for buying new models (not ecological at all even if it is economically feasible)
432,"Worst company I've ever had to deal with.10 customer service calls are being transferred around, and still haven't fixed the stupid insta ink issue that has my printer suspended... yes again my printer is ""suspended"" because of their program issue. What a joke. You spend hundreds of dollars on a printer that then can be turned off remotely and not allowed to print because of HPs rules. Where's the lawsuit for this? Sign me up"
433,"Awful customer experience, made an order over the phone 2 weeks ago - was promised next day delivery which didn't happen. After calling explaining that the product didn't arrive the next day they said that they've never offered next day delivery. Arranged for delivery company to collect the product for return, no update or email regarding this. A week after I called up and explained that the delivery man never showed up for collection - went for the return label option which was meant to take 2-3 days to be emailed. Here we are a week later with no return label. Been on hold for an amassed 3.5 hours. Been left completely in the dark, would not recommend."
434,Nigh on impossible to get hold of them.
435,"What should I say, the Costumer Service is 0, they does not help at all. Their product is also disappointed. I bough a laptop HP Pavilion 15-dk1049nq, after 15 months the video card broke or I don't know what happened but it does not work. I tried to repair with updates from their sites but did not help. There is no an email to write to them, just a stupid robot. Never ever HP."
436,"I bought sets of 304 tricolour ink cartridges , all prommised to print out to 100+ pages , black +300 aprox - none of this happenned very dissapointed on this as I am working in th eeducation and colours are very importantThe product did not provide even 20 colour pages and black ink not even 50 VERY DISAPPOINTED :( loads of £££ threw away"
437,"Absolutely rubbish company i placed an order on the 30th of September suppose to be here by the 6th but got an email saying it was delayed, i proceeded to message a agent in whatapp as i couldnt get through to anyone from the stupid atuomated service. Finally got the number for the sales people to be told my whole order was cancelled due to one item not being in stock. I was told it will happen again if the product is not in stock again. So know im almost £800 down and have no laptop for uni. Dont waste your money go to apple or currys as HP is a waste of time rubbish company."
438,"I order a laptop on line it said it will be delivered on 3 to 5 business days .. a month came and nothing, I call them and asked them to cancel! They refused.. stating that the laptop was on its way, I said I don’t want it any more because the long delayed, and that I have bought another one, one more week and it came, someone only house sign and now I have a laptop still in the box that I don’t want, I call asking for a return label and they are ignoring my request! I want my money back…and they refused to process a return less a return label, I have dispute this with my bank!! And they said now to stop the dispute or they would never process my return!! Are you kidding me.. is been a nightmare… I’m so upset … I wish I would have check reviews before!! I feel cheated!! And taken for a ride!! They lied!! Horrible company"
439,GREAT SERVICE WHEN I CALLED TO GET RECOVERY MEDIA SHIPPED THE NEXT DAY
440,"Tech ""Support"" ZERO Stars. Avoid.Don't expect a £1000 PC to work for more than a year. The second it goes out of warrantee you will be charged £500 to fix, regardless of whether the problem is a manufacturing defect or not."
441,"If I can give this company a 0 star, I will! I bought a laptop and it’s overheating, called them and was told they will send me a return label, it’s been 7 days now and still no return label! They won’t pick or respond to my email, I’m going to dispute the payment with my bank and get myself a better product, I don’t need any exchange anymore. I need them to give me my money back. Run from them! They are useless!"
442,ZERO STARS.  What a piece of crap this company is.  Ordered a computer that was available for shipment in August.  It is October and still no computer.  Comes from China.  FALSE ADVERTISING AND NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.  DO NOT BUY.
443,"Terrible experience! Avoid HP like the plague...I bought a 7134 printer. It came with ink. Didn't manage to print more than a 10 pages. Shortly after they said the ink has dried. ""You should subscribe to Instant ink"" I subscribe. The delivery takes forever and Royal mail loses it. They say they sent me a new one. Never got it. I call again, they say we don't know what happened, we'll send another...it never arrived. Support on WhatsApp didn't answer until the next day. I'm now trying to run my business without a printer for the past 2 months.I had to come back and update my review because I contacted them again. After endless hours of waiting for them to contact me on WhatsApp, not only did they not help but the agent said ""sorry my working hours are over""...And just like that, without passing me on to someone else, he left the conversation...I give them 1 star because Trustpilot doesn't allow less."
444,"I wish i could rate a zero star. This is the worst company EVER. Brand new convertible hp envy broken in less than 4 days, paid for guarantee and eligible for a replacement but they won’t send me the prepaid return label. Takes ages to get to customer assistants and when they do, they keep repeating the same stuff with no help. Terribly  frustrated because I use this for uni, and can’t complete my projects. Wish i had known better"
445,"Don't buy HP printers. I bought an HP photo ""envy"" 6220.  It was sold with a free ink trial. After three hours including an hour with their ""support"" person I could not get the subscription started to enable the free trial.  BUT they have taken money from the card! If a member of the public offered a free trial then failed to complete the transaction but took money from a credit card they may well be prosecuted....  So I have a printer that does not work (out of ink) and have been charged money for a free trial. It will be replaced with an Epson, Brother in fact any brand but HP"
446,"I made a purchase on hp.com using chat assistance. I was told I would receive an email with a link to complete the purchase. That was when the poo poo hit the fan. Not five minutes after clicking the link, and HP could not find my order. No record of it whatsoever. I was told to ""give it 24 hours"" to process. What?? So, I asked to cancel the order, I would purchase another way. Well, you guessed it, I could not cancel it for 24 hours. Again, WT*?? Called Customer support and that was a complete waste of time. They are not trained to answer technical questions and I got responses like ""that's what I can tell from my screen."" How is it they took my payment information in a snap, but they could not cancel the order five minutes later?? If it smells like poop, it probably is. If I could give zero stars, I would. My best advice:  DO NOT BUY DIRECTLY FROM HP.COM.  You will live to regret it. I still do."
447,"Spent over £1000 on a new HP ENVYDon't envy anyone who needs supportWhatsApp chat took 6 hours without conclusionFacebook message went unansweredIt is as if HP senior management doesn't ever respond to feedback, but how would they when HP makes it more difficult to reach them than winding back timeThe support agents appear to be ill trained and have difficulty in responding to the question asked - WHY would they ask about my Microsoft account on an HP chat?"
448,"Received email confirmation as accepted, delivery should of been 2 days and still no product, have sent an email to chase up and no response after 5 days.Very poor, so I will be cancelling my order and go with a retailer more reliable.It's a shame as the price was good but delivery and customer service is not up to standards!"
449,Waste of time company didn’t give any details or updates about my return collection time or day had me waiting about like an idiot and then told me it should come but it never did to collect my pc! Had a faulty pc and they don’t seem to care of have any urgency after telling me that it should be sorted as soon as
450,HP Customer support is the worse. They have absolutely do not care or attempt to understand your needs. They just want you to buy their products every year when their firmware screws up your printer. My printer physically works but there firmware updates screws everything up and it fails to print afterwards. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling and it should not be this way. HP as a whole sucks. Nice products but they DO NOT STAND BEHIND THERE PRODUCTS!!!! I'm switching over to Epson or Brothers next I wont be buying another HP Product ever and I suggest to everyone to do the same!!!!!!!!!
451,"Initially, camera was not working, given for servicing, they took more than a week to rectify it. After that system started asking to reload the chrome OS..initially didn't cause any problem, we recover the OS and load it.. but afterwards for every log in it started asking for chrome OS installation which is hassle. Contacted customer service of HP where we get any proper responses or support. Finally they send a quote to rectify the issue which is more than double the actual price of the product So if you don't want to loose your money and time, don't buy HP products especially this chrome book. Bought this Chromebook for daughter's education and due to lack of support and responses from HP, spoiled 3 weeks of my daughters study. Then we decided to chuck the Chromebook in Rubbish bin. Previously i had a similar issue with HP laptop, but that was not in NZ. DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM HP"
452,"Purchased an HP laptop, within 6 months the laptop was sent off for a repair in warranty of course.The service warranty is only valid for 3 months so its practically non existing.The same issue has occurred after 1 year of owner ship and because the warranty is up HP will not touch it. The customer service agents are rude and belittling. Spoke with the manager because my product was deemed fixed and the issue will keep coming back! The hard drive keeps burning out no excessive downloads don't go on dodgy sites no streaming illegally.HP will not support their own products and treat customers like scum. I hope they see this you're in violation of consumer rights act of 2015. Will never buy an HP device ever again."
453,poor product backed by an even worse returns procedure.should offer a refund under uk statutory trading laws if less than 30 days - but they want you to cal 3 phone numbers and speak to 3 people to return a faulty product.Crap
454,"Ordered hp laptop, faulty from opening. Was offered a replacement however the problem seemed to have resolved and was reassured warranty still in place. Touchscreen stopped working and was crashing. Took 2 months to finally get it in for repair- packaged and dropped at dpd point. When Hp have received the laptop they said it was cracked! And that this isn’t covered under warranty. There was no crack before packaging! I was offered to repair this for £400+, more than I paid for the laptop!! Instead I have now received the laptop back, still faulty, and now cracked. Will never ever order from here again. The customer service has been awful- emails ignored, promises of ringing back in 24 hours with nothing for a week. I would advise anyone to buy a HP product, especially from the website itself."
455,Bought a printer 2 years ago with scanning options through an app. As such very happy with it. Suddenly I have to make an account to use my own machine. Absolutely unacceptable behavior
456,I would like to give NO stars. Ordered next day delivery - three days later still no laptop. Cannot get an email response and the wait time on the phone is over 45 minutes - this is when I hung up. Now no one will be in for dellivery and it's missed the deadline. Worst experience online.
457,"hp printer that stopped working after the warranty was up. They comepletely removed it the printer from my app. Here’s what gets me, they’re telling the whole world it’s their power source. Like the US power grid is no good. Yeah okay. Are you kidding me? Everyone having this problemj should file a complaint with their state attorney generals office so they can hit them with a class action lawsuit."
458,"Hp omen 2020 amd edition, flawed with bugs, contant bsod when battery is reaching 100% and hp just ignores this issue, horrible business practice, this business shouldn't exist"
459,"Paid for instant ink, worked fine for a while but for some reason didn’t receive my ink. Contacted HP the issue is still ongoing and they’ve been trying to solve it for 2 days now. They keep giving me tedious tasks like resetting the Wi-Fi, they clearly just don’t know what the issue is. I simply wanted my ink sent to me."
460,Tried to install the ink service they took the money from my account and then said I couldn’t have the service I then spent over an hour on the WhatsApp talking to some guy in circles eventually just disappeared and left the conversation . So they have now had my money and are Ghosting me
461,"I rang HP technical support to obtain help with my HP printer going off line. The guy I spoke to (American accent) was fantastic! He was respectful, polite, professional and extremely helpful, fixing my issue with ease. I was very impressed with this service. Well done that man!"
462,"Please don't buy any HP productVery bad consultation experience. Bought LaserJet (COLOR LASER JET PRO MFP M177FW) printer few years back, got problem, no more warranty, then they don't want to repair. They can check and advise for repair, then quote charges required to repair, I don't mind. But when no warranty they don't want to repair. I just bought the cartridge almost RM1K. Then cannot be used just because they refuse to repair."
463,"I bought a HP deskjet 2135 but within no time at all neither laptop (also HP) would recognise it, so i went out bought another cable thinking that it might be the problem but no, turns out it is the terrible software that comes with the printer is buggy beyond belief. Next problem the printer shows that there is no black ink so I went out and bought a new ink this time XL so that way I wouldnt have to buy again so quickly but now the brand new ink doesnt register, if I google the problem it seems that hundreds or perhaps thousands have the exact same problem but there is no fix!! Customer service is non existant and wont help you at all just give basic instructions like, turn on and off the printer!! I have several HP devices but I will never in a million years buy another thing from these cowboys."
464,"0 Customer support was trying to get in touch for 2 days. No live chat, no phone call answer no nothing. I only got an answer when i pretended to want to buy something but they said sorry we can't help you. It's already been delayed for 2 days and now the estimated delivery day is gone. I am never buying anything for HP again."
465,"Customer service absolutely useless.  I bought an HP printer which came with 6months free Instant Ink (seemingly a good deal).  When my ink cartridges were ready for replacement the HP app would not allow me to order new cartridges.  I contacted HP customer service, explained the problem and was told that a 'technical glitch' had prevented my Instant Ink enrolment.  After over 2hours in contact with HP we were no further on, the guy wanted me to re-instal the HP app.  I asked for assurances that this would not set my Instant Ink enrolment outside the registration period.  I was given that re-assurance.  With no surprise to me after I re-installed I was told that my registration period had been exceeded.  After over 4hours we had got nowhere, and I had to purchase the cartridges, just as if I had never had the Instant Ink offer.  HP Customer Service seem to think that customers want to spend their whole time sorting out their problems, and that entirely not solving the problem is a useful exercise.  Quite useless, worsened by being in the UK  in agonisingly slow contact with some guy in the States."
466,"My HP Envy 600 series printer is the worst printer I have ever owned or used--and I've been using and owning printers for 30 years. This machine requires 20 mi=nutes of cleaning and maintenance every single time you want to print a page. It does not matter if you just printed one yesterday; it won't print today. This will be the last HP product I ever buy. Printers are the only technology that has become worse over the years, and HP carries a large part of the blame. Trash product from a trash company."
467,"Like many others experienced poor customer support.  Purchased an HP Deskjet 2622 in January, 2022 (through Amazon).  This is the third HP printer I have purchased throughout a good number of years.  This one was used only as a copier.  Stopped printing in September of 2022.  Still under warranty.  Attempts to contact Customer Support was less than helpful.  Either could not find the printer or they linked it to one that was purchased in 2016.  I was willing to send them a printed copy of when it was purchased.  There seemed to be difficulty understanding this.  In the end there seemed to be nothing I could do to resolve this."
468,Do not even go near this company. Just read all the other reviews to find out why. Got a defective product and I'm now down £600.
469,"I should have checked here before ordering laptop. Had a nighmtare with delivery (see parcel force reviews) . When I told HP about why and how I still haven't had laptop they didn't care. 1st rep disconnected. 2nd said ok what do you want to do, when I said cancel and they can get there delivery returned , they were ok , goodbye. I just claimed back through credit card for refund, can't be bothered with hp."
470,"Well, this is officially the last time I buy an HP. They've never been particularly fast, I've always had issues with them just having the slowest days, but today was the final straw when I couldn't connect my computer to the wifi, and called the wifi company first. They confirmed it was an issue with my laptop, and so I called the costumer support number they provided from hp. Yo. They says I would have to pay almost fifty bucks just to talk to a tech support person. What the hell?! Seriously so screwed up. Screw HP."
471,"Sent wrong ink for printer and refused to send correctorder after one month. How does this company survivewhen it does not bother, please use any one but HPRon"
472,"I'm absolutely beside myself. I'm at the point I hope an astroid hits the earth. There is no fixing all this garbage, we have to start over. Did in bread finally catch up with america?? Why does hp need access to all my pictures to connect to the printer. I can't believe people don't check this stuff. Zero reason why they need access to that other then are the worst humanity has to offer. On top of having zero instructions. There was no installation explanation just troubleshooting!! This planet makes me afraid to go outside, try anything new. The dumbest and worst people imaginable are now in charge of everything. Don't let anyone you know but anything HP aka huge pile"
473,I received a laptop that does not work properly. They charge me restocking fee $70this is horrible. will never order from them again
474,"Their WhatsApp service platform is horrible, they would only reply hours later, sometimes even a full day. Horrible service"
475,"I bought a brand new HP printer from Amazon 2 months ago. All of sudden it started to make an awful grinding noise. HP said send it back for a new one. I had to pay one dollar through a web portal. I couldn’t load it on any of my devices. They wouldn’t take credit card information over the phone. That was one strike. They said they wouldn’t issue a replacement until they got the damaged one back. They would mail me a box and shipping label. I tried numerous times to get the status of these items, could not get through. Final someone who barely spoke English told me to wait 48 hours and it should ship. It’s going to take me almost a month or more to get a new printer because they won’t ship the new one till they get the old one back. The only time you get someone who speaks English is when you call sales. I’m not going to by HP in the future."
476,I had problem with My G8 Notebook and asked for Return. After 14 days of Return I still haven't received any Email regarding my Reimbursement.Very Lasy and Uncomfortable.
477,Their printers require you to use their ink and need to be online& connected to hp smart. Mine won;t work offline. Won't buy an HP next.
478,"If I could give 0, I would. Bought a £450 laptop in 2020 and it's been nothing but trouble. I've now gone back to using my £200 11 year old Toshiba which performs much better despite having less ram. The processors HP mostly use (anything worse than I7) are awful and couldn't power a game of snake. Why a £450 laptop in 2020 didn't come with at least an I5 is beyond me. You need at least an I5 and 8gb ram just to run all the HP bloatware that comes pre-installed and drains the CPU. So sick of wiping and reinstalling windows. A company as big as HP with a TP rating of 1/5 is outrageous but also somehow exaggerating the quality of their products - use any other brand but HP!"
479,"Happy with new laptop, it has changed quite a bit from previously so was a little confusing"
480,I am on the 4th round of telephone calls to their customer support who have told me they will take a certain action and then not bothered. The last time on Friday when I asked to speak to management i was promised I would receive a phone call between 1 and 2 and of course they didn't call I even said to the person taking the call 'I know no one is going to call me' and he said 'I can assure you they will!!' Its SO frustrating!!!! My laptop is under a year old and has not worked properly for about 4 months. I can see why there are so many awful reviews. Totally unacceptable customer service. Its a total joke! Sort it out HP
481,"Absolutely diabolical customer service.I bought a HP laptop from their website at the beginning of August. It wasn't right for me and the fan was too noisy so I initiated a return within 14 days through the website. I was told HP would be reaching out with further information and was allowed to pick a return date for Parcelforce to come and collect the laptop. That date came and went, no collection. I decided to sit tight as was told HP would contact me about the return and had yet to hear anything, despite having booked the collection date that had now passed.A week later, I get a text from Parcelforce saying they will collect my package the next day. I am not even in the country at this point. I had stupidly assumed they would give me the option to choose another date after not collecting on my 1st preference. There's no contact details for Parcelforce in the text and I still haven't heard from HP. That date passes, no text to advise of the collection attempt after that and still no contact from HP. When I return from holiday I go back in to my account and it doesn't even mention I've initiated a return. When I tried to initiate another return, it told me I couldn't return it anymore. Live chat didn't worm, neither did WhatsApp, so I ended up spending half an hour on the phone to get through to three different departments and am finally told by a nice bloke called Dave that he will email me a return postage label for me to send it back myself.I breathe a sigh of relief at this point. But no, no returns postage label is emailed to me, instead an automated email in about seven different languages comes through with a link to their returns policy page. Which is of absolutely no use to me, hence why I called them!Needless to say I have emailed a complaint to their post sales inbox, raised three cases through their website and I have still yet to actually be contacted by anyone.I am beyond disgusted with this customer service and will be doing some research to see if HP are covered under consumer duty and are regulated by anyone I can chat to.The fact you have to login to their website to even attain their contact details is somewhat suspicious. Really, really disappointed and worn out by this whole experience. I will never buy through them again."
482,Brought a printer and my god the instructions are in every language but English the little that is in English won't help you do more than turn it on.I watched YouTube videos and It Just won't connect to my device even following the YouTube video.There customer services are only open Mon- Friday 9-5 extremely unhelpful  ready to send this crap back Can't log in for online support as it's asking for serial number to access it and it doesn't recognise it ...they really don't want to help people do they
483,If it was possible to leave a lower number I would.  The warranty process for a printer is ridiculous.  Agents that know nothing leading you through steps that prove nothing.  No logic to any of it.  Just wasting your time while they manage three of four chats at a time.  Wasting your time.  No results.  hoping you just go away.
484,"I bought a docking station that #1 didn't have an HDMI port.  Which is pathetic in of itself; so I went ahead and bought a WGA chord to connect my station to my monitor.. the loading dock doesn't project my laptop onto my monitor.. I double checked and confirmed the docking station is compatible with my laptop.  I tried calling tech support; the automatic answering service voice recognition is terrible.  there is no control put in place to speak to a representative so you have to sit through the automated service go through everything.. then when I actually spoke to someone, I got  transferred to 3 different people, having to re-provide my serial number, reason for calling each time.. then they finally said oh we can probably help but you'd have to pay for the service.. HP as a company is borderline pathetic to begin with, I only had to buy this because this was for a work laptop.. but the pathetic customer service they have brought it to a new low.. essentially give you a fault product, then you have to pay them to fix it.. this should be illegal."
485,"The greediest, grabbiest, most disgusting & useless company out there. All they want is for you to sign up to their online ink subscription - which is more expensive than anywhere else on the internet. Crooks."
486,They dont stand behind product. Do yourself a favor never buy a thing from them. It doesnt get much worse
487,"I'm disappointed to be writing this feedback as the product (brand-new PC) and many aspects of the loaded software look good. However, the technical support (via WhatsApp) - was very, very slow. To make things worse, I was left 'hanging' for 40 mins mid-chat. I followed up by using the phone support - two attempts. Both involved a complete wipe and re-load of the system. In a third attempt - the tech support guy seemed to have no record of what had already been done. He concluded that I should seek replacement / refund and gave me another number to call. That number - 'in a queue' for 40+ mins - then gave up. Tried again - next day - more than 1 hour. During that wait - I read Trustpilot reviews - and changed my mind from replacement - to refund. That's what I have done. We'll see what happens. The PC is to be collected in about a week. Such a pity hp!! You need to spend some money on your after-sales support....."
488,Read the other reviews - HP sucks! I hate them and it’s such a pain to contact a HUMAN!
489,"I honestly don't know where to start. If youre thinking of buying something from HP, DONT! I brought a £3000+ pc from HP in January and have had issues with it for the last four months at this point. I contacted them two months into me having the issue, the first month of my time was wasted trying to make sense of what the Whatsapp team were trying to say and what to do, they very clearly have no idea what their job is and are just following some sort of help sheet to tell people what to do. I spent a month going back a forth with HP Support on WhatsApp because they clearly were incapable of contacting DPD to come and collect my faulty device. So after begging for a further two days I was finally able to cancel the repair order because it was not worth the effort I was putting in because they simply did not care! I then contacted hp over the phone for support and finally got somewhere after being ignored 3 times and them failing to call me back another 4 times but I finally was able to make another repair order with them because the finally believed that the pc had to be seen by someone (which I had told them from the start). Now I am at the point where HP are incapable of sending out the right size box for the pc, they have now 3 times sent out the same box that is half the size of the pc it's self I have offered to read them the dimensions from their own website if they need to know how big the pc is but 3 times now DPD had arrived with the same flimsy plastic box first time we told them it was too small the second time they brought a unprotected plastic box then the third time they brought the same box back with padding it in, which again was half of the size of the pc. Somebody needs to take over their support team and hire people who know what they're doing and can actually help you because at this point in time you'd get more help from asking a bunch of toddlers what the issue with your faulty product from them is. Oh and if you ask to speak to someone higher up you are given the support teams phone number so yeah not too sure what I'm supposed to do with that, at this point its been 3 almost 4 months of my time wasted and I am seriously thinking about taking legal action!!!"
490,"I bought a laptop and had to return it. 2 weeks later, I have no refund and HP customer support is the worst I've ever encountered - terrible waits on phone, no response to emails, stuck in endless loops on website tryi g to get help. Really disappointed."
491,Absolutly rubbish - They took the laptop away to be repaird - twice - it came back with a dameded corner and thety said that this was misuse by the user. They then went on to offer another repair for the damage at my expence. For service 0 for grasp of English 0. For grasping of money from the customer 100.
492,"Purchased a reverb g2 headset which i must say is very good. That's it the one positive.I'm one of many g2 owners who have to go through the terrible customer support nightmare to have a replacement cable sent out only to find the replacement also fails. Now i'm out of warranty, HP don't have any replacement cables in stock (so far 4 months) and it appears i may, also have, an expensive paperweight. At least i had just over a year out of it.Really cannot understand how such bad customer service is allowed to be acceptable!"
493,Support are useless - hang up and dont call back
494,"I have had endless problems with my HP printer. Print head broke on day 3 and printer was replaced under warrantee. Then the blue print head broke just out of warranty. I had set up instant ink but when I cancelled because I didn't want tp pay for colour cartridges I couldnt use, the printer wouldn't work at all. I had to replace all cartridges just to be able to print in black. Now it looks like the black print head has gone too. Long winded way of speaking to customer services and they never deal with the problem. I would absolutely warn everyone away from buying such rubbish. Not environmentally friendly at all due to the fact they blame everything on cartridges and keep sending new ones which don't work. Waste of large amount of money."
495,"Pure robbery. I never buy an HP printer again if I fill up my catridge with ink, the printer is erroring, I cannot use any other catridge than HP catridges, it is not eco friendly, the worse printers ever"
496,"They have no support. They just want to hook you into an ink service and manipulate you financially that way. They show a 4.6 rating on google, but you can’t leave a google review which makes both Google look like they are in bed with HP and like HP has clout to fake their ratings!"
497,"HP is the worst company I ever dealt with. Uk call the UK helpline then you're transferred somewhere in USA Canada you have to give details about 3 advisors then they say we only deal with USA customers. Dont ever by HP envy 6000 these always go offline, and can't do a simple job of printing although connected by USB. I will never buy HP printers again."
498,"The one star average rating speaks for itself (is the worst I've seen for a company on truspilot, actually). In short, I bought a malfunctioning product, then got fobbed off by tech support, then my one star review on HP.com got deleted because it ""didn't meet review standards""; which presumably requires the review to be positive :-) Complete and utter joke of a company!"
499,"I thought this was a High Profile company. However they are no better than a cowboy builder. Ordered laptop that was sold as in stock with next day delivery. I received emails from HP sales but could not track order. Message came up Access Denied. The HP contact number supplied by PayPal invoice was an unobtainable phone number. The next day email links worked order being packed and awaiting stock. I phoned HP sales line to check order, I was quoted it was being built. I cancelled order, 4 hours later I got email that it had been dispatched. PayPal refunded me but I've had massive issues trying to return item or even being able to get a bit of discount to keep it"
500,If I could give this company a review lower than one I most definitely would my computer is trash it doesn’t save any files and runs slow every Hp laptop I have gotten is a piece of you know what . They are cheaply made for a ridiculous price most definitely taking my business to another company
501,"I have been trying to return a printer for two weeks.  Never, ever had such poor service.  I have phoned endlessly only to hear the same message telling me that I am in a queue.  Emailed; no Reply. Just been told by sales team that a 3 hour wait for answer is the norm.  Awful!!!!"
502,"Terrible experience, no one was willing to help me solve the problem and I was actually disconnected from an online chat mid conversation as the agent was clearly unwilling to help answer any more of my questions."
503,"My HP computer failed while I was in work, I tried to contact them (which was difficult), I then got through to Gurpreet who gave me advice I couldn't administer to the computer because it was broken"
504,"I won't bore you with all of the nitty, gritty details but in summary, a large All-In-One computer that is still under warranty developed a hardware issue. HP's solution is to collect the computer and to return it in 10-15 days!!!!!!After working in the computer industry for 30+ years I know for sure that the solution to the hardware issue I have is to exchange out a Wi-Fi card which will take no more than 30 mins. So, my question is why is it going to take 10-15 days? I assume the answer must be one of:1) The PC will be collected and returned using a horse and cart which will need frequent rests on its epic journey to the repair centre, or2) Repairs are carried out somewhere like Outer Mongolia, hence the transport time, or3) My PC will be sat in some warehouse somewhere for 14 days doing nothing waiting for someone to carry out the 30 min repair.I have used multiple HP products in both business and at home for decades but they have had their very last money from me, EVER!What a complete joke a once great company has turned into."
505,I have a HP Envy 5530 printer that was printing badly so I have just installed a new HP301black print cartridge.  My printer then displayed the message Older cartridge cartridge(s) for older generation of printer.  I have checked the cartridge against the 1 removed and it is the same. Apparently HP update the firmware periodically so you cannot use none HP ink cartridges but I have always used HP cartridges and am really annoyed as I purchased several new ones about a year ago that I can no longer use. This is totally unfair and I will not be buying a new HP printer again.
506,"They are just pathetic honestly.Trying to purchase a 2000.00 plus printer and cannot complete online purchase as their website freezes. Waisted a full day on this. Was told by service department to call, only to end up with a telephone service that says no sells personal can take any orders. Then for icing on the cake I get an email confirming they have all my items in basket ready to be purchased and that I can complete the online purchase and when I click the link it says basket is empty. What a joke as a company, I assure you Packards did not build his company on such sub standards as this.They should be for sale"
507,"Unhappy with HP Pavilion 15-cs3970nd, you cant control the external mouse when charging the laptop or when a usb is plugged in. Also battery power has dropped massively after 1 year of use."
508,I have never experienced such repeated rudeness from customer services and lack of assistance.  I cannot get my issue resolved by anyone and have spent over five hours trying to contact HP in the last three weeks.  It seems they are deliberately obnoxious and unwilling to assist customers.
509,"After weeks of going backwards & forwards, I was told that the cost for fixing a broken screen would be the same price as I had paid for the computer 10 months ago.  I was then offered a 20% cashback (10% in writing but definitely 20% verbally) as a goodwill gesture because of the hassle I had gone through.  Two weeks later I purchase the new computer and suddenly HP policy has changed and they won't honour their offer of any cashback.  Don't expect any promised call-backs and don't believe a word they say.  Will never buy from them again."
510,We had an old printer (Epson) and thought it would be brilliant if we had one with all the bells and whistles. So we got HP all in one with 6 months free ink.. big mistake. Before the 6 months is up we got a call saying we need to set up a payment system to pay for the ink. NO!!! It's free ink for 6 months and then we can buy our own. It will not work now and can't print anything. We even got the ink from the shop and still nothing. It's a waist of money and just sits there now gathering dust. Never buy into this product because you will regret it. We are looking at a new Epson now and should have done this in the first place.
511,I bought an HP Pavilion in late July which included Microsoft Office Family.  I was shocked when I found out it was not installed on the computer and HP wants to charge me another $49 to get the product key.  They call it tech support.The computer is okay but HP cannot rob me just like that.  I need the product key.
512,"For 2 years now, since Black Friday 2019, i have a HP Pavilion Gaming 15-EC0000NV, and oh boy, that laptop is a literal nightmare.First off, they cheaped out on producing good hinges, and instead gave us crappy hinges that wobble since purchase date. And what do you know, the left hinge gave up on December 2021, which made the laptop nearly impossible to open and posed a risk of breaking the screen. Speaking of the screen, i tried repairing the issue by replacing the display's back, but HP had it stuck in place making it very difficult to remove. Not to mention that the tabs blended with the laptop's plastic colour and i didn't even see them, making me use iso alc, which ruined the layers of the screen, forcing me to buy a new one. Unfortunately, the tape which held the screen  to the back casing was non-existent, so i had to put the screen inside the laptop and now the bezels are the ones holding it in place. Like, who thought it was a good idea to replicate the same garbage Samsung does with their battery adhesive? They could have EASILY used the screw method, but instead they did the adhesive method. How dumb!And do you know what else's dumb? HP's Bang and Olufsen audio enhancements.  They were on by default and all they did is ruin and oversaturate the audio, and because of this, i have them off since purchase date. The equaliser sucks too. It's just the standard trashy Realtek equaliser but with a diffrent skin, and it does nothing to the audio!But what makes me angry is the fact that those black plastic things around the Ryzen 5 3550H CPU made it go always at 93 degress at full load due to uneven trash, and the result was far worse when the GTX 1050 inside it was in Action. The CPU kept thermal throttling at full load due to this problem, and do you know what i had to do to fix this such issue?I had to take apart the laptop, clean out the old paste, remove the pathetic plastic thingies, and replace them with thin tape to insulate the components around the CPU and GPU dies, which dropped the temps of the CPU down to 84 degrees, and when in game when the GTX 1050 was in action, it gave me 93 degress on the CPU when it was completely stressed.Speaking of cooling, the cooling on it isn't proper. It's using fans which are probably recycled from non-gaming HPs, and they used a 2 thick heatpipe soloution sharing heat from the CPU and GPU and called it a day. It would have been better if the cooling was seperate.And oh boy, the audio jack on it has broken on April 2021. The audio jack was so soft that it kept disconnecting with the tiniest bit of force, and now to listen with headphones on, i have to use a DAC via USB-C or USB-A or use the cursed Bluetooth tech which has latency issues.Speaking of wireless technologies, the Realtek RTL8822CE inside the laptop was the worst offender of all. The settings on it were confusing, it would keep kicking my wireless earbuds off, and it didn't work with the 5GHz acsess point from my phone. No suprise here as Realtek WiFi sucks for dear eternity.I replaced the trash wifi on it with a better Intel Dual Band wifi adaptor which supported the 5 GHz band on my phone and fixed all Bluetooth issues. Do not buy HP unless you have experience in repairs, as their Tech Support accoding to others is like trying to talk to a Gacha kid on Discord who takes attention seeking too far and would make you throw your phone onto the wall. And while mine is quite questionable in terms of build quality and cooling soloution, the keyboard has nice key travel and the touchpad is good, the screen had OK colors minus the bad viewing angles, a reason why IPS is far more superior (it has an IPS display rn) and the motherboard doesn't have defects that would impact its functionality, minus the trashy headphone jack. Still, that doesn't mean you should really trust HP nowdays. Do your own research before buying a laptop.HP needs to improve their quality control and their products and build them again like tanks like how they did before 2017."
513,"The worst customer service I've ever experienced. It seems like they turn their live chat service on whenever they feel like it. Customer advisers behave like bots and respond to every question with a scripted answer. The phone lines are also absolutely garbage, I was on hold for over 50 minutes every time I called and nobody ever answered. Its took me almost a month to return a laptop to this incompetent and useless company. For a company of this size, the customer service is literally no-existent, avoid them like the plague"
514,Can I have zero star? Very very poor service. I am waiting more then 7 days but problem not solved.
515,"I would give 0 if I can. Called them two days in a row about my refund (brand new laptop overheat and has audio issues that no one can solve). First day: no one responds after a 40-minute wait. Second day: no one responds after 1-hour wait. Called the sales team regarding this instead of the post-sales team. They picked up instantly. They were rude with the 'not my problem attitude'. Not only that, they said that the post-sales service exists because 'they can see them right there'. I told them it takes an hour for them (the post-sales team) to pick up. The response was 'some people wait for 3-4 hours. This is what HP's service provides.' Apparently, they don't really care. I will be taking my business elsewhere."
516,"Very crap service from this brand. Got 9 months free instant ink with the printer, no instructions on how to claim. Waste of time and money."
517,"Never again will I buy a HP laptop due to the inconsistency of their wifi cards, I recently bought a new HP laptop and wifi speed is never constant and constantly fluctuates. I have a 7 year old Macbook Pro that can knock spots off the new HP laptop for wifi speeds."
518,"Bought a laptop in September 2021. In January the screen started to pixilate. As a minister I had bought it for church use. Specifically for PowerPoint for Sunday services and YouTube videos of services. In returning it to HP they told me that the damage to the screen was caused by me, which I strongly dispute. HP wanted 70% of what I'd paid for the laptop to repair it. They failed to communicate any further with me. They weren't interested in my side of the story. Their customer service is shocking. Their attitude was shocking. I will never ever purchase another item from HP."
519,I have a support package which I paid for. I organised collection. A sealed box arrived with no instructions. I asked hp support what do I do now with the box- how do I organise collection. They just said someone will be round. They never were. No emails absolutely no contact. Despite my efforts to get laptop collected absolutely noone at support was capable of organising it or helping me. Laptop remains broken. The support package was a total waste of money. Even though its still apparently active. Absolute joke.I also add that I wasted days of my life waiting for them to take me off hold on the phone or respond in their Web chat. I've never seen such an awful after care service. AVOID at all costs
520,"Absolutely shocking customer service, the worst I have had in many, many years from a large company. Avoid buying anything from them as if there is a problem it is impossible to get through to anyone. As someone else said, when you call the UK customer service number you are just left waiting with a recorded message that says ""your estimated wait time is 10 minutes"" then a minute later a different recording says ""7 minutes"" ten seconds later ""5 minutes"" and then 10 seconds later ""2 minutes"". The recording then starts all over again. I waited 40 minutes and just gave up. I have sent two emails to customer services in the last two weeks and received no reply. The order number I was given doesn't work on the tracking service, oh and the online chat service doesn't work. The whole thing is an absolute joke. I was told my monitor would take 2 days to arrive, its been two weeks and I have no idea when and if it will arrive. AVOID ORDERING FROM HP AT ALL COSTS."
521,"BEWARE OF HP TELEPHONE BAIT AND SWITCH SCAM!!!I called in to order a laptop on 8/26/2022. The representative who took my order worked out pricing with me to include the laptop, multiport hub, and a 3-year Care Pack. The price was very good, and I was pleased. I asked the man to reconfirm the order, and specifically that the Care Pack was included. He assured me it was. He told me it would show up in the order confirmation email.I received the email... no Care Pack was included, so I called back in. The next guy tried to sell me lots of things, including the Care Pack that was supposed to have been part of my order. He told me it wasn't part of my order but he could add it for $200. After explaining what happened multiple times, and a few attempts by him to sell me software, printers and ink refill packages, I asked him to escalate to a manager. He agreed, and dumped my call into a hold queue. After 40 minutes of lousy hold music, and a parallel-but-futile attempt  to work through the Chat feature, I was connected to a different frontline sales person who knew nothing of the order! This woman again tried to sell me the Care Pack I had previously  purchased, but agreed to connect me to her manager. I asked her to stay on the line while she transferred my call, she said she would... BUT she quickly dumps my call into a technical support queue and disappears.Meanwhile, the Chat person is trying to sell me the entire order all over at a much higher price. By now, I'm curious just how horribly HP would treat me before this sad experience ended. So I hung in there on both Chat and the phone.The Chat person finally suggests that a manager should review the call to see if the sales person did what I claim he did. I agreed with this, but then she tells me she'll get back with me in 24-48 hours! They took my money quick enough, but now it's going to take 2 days to figure out what the guy committed to selling me??? I think not.In the meantime, my phone call is still in the technical support queue with bad music and an intermittent message informing me of ""longer than usual wait times""...After well over an hour of this hellish run-around, I finally gave up and canceled the order.I have purchased HP computers exclusively for many years, and that loyalty would have continued. However, after the unscrupulous business practices I've experienced in this process, along with the difficulty in getting them to honor the Support Agreement on a previous computer, I doubt I will buy another product from HP. If they treat me this way at the point of sale, how can I believe they'll stand by their commitments later on? Beside, I found a superior machine for much lower cost, and that company was honest and straightforward through the entire buying experience."
522,"Bought an Envy Printer in July 2021 and signed up for the Instant Ink programme.  12 months later,still using the original cartridges. Now according to HP using WIFI they can monitor how much ink and how many pages you have printed off. Yet they still charge you monthly for ink you don't obviously need. They even suggested changing my plan to their lowest one of £0.99 per month.  I exceeded the printing plan and they charged me £4 for using my own ink, paper and electricity! Now I've left the scheme, which means I've been charged 12 months worth of black and colour ink cartridges which they'll now sell on to some other sucker instead of forwarding them on to me after I paid for them !! Absolute ripoff and I'm sure highly illegal if not morally wrong."
523,Returned an item and HP claim i returned a different item?They have my laptop and my £2000!!! dont even bother.
524,"I bought Chromebook directly from HP UK with extended 3 years warranty. Software stopped working after 9 months, when contacted HP support, spend over 1 hr on the phone to try to prove that Chromebook does not work.  HP agreed to take for repair, send Chromebook to HP for repair, no communication received about repair, until I chased to be told that HP won't fulfil warranty. Logged complaint, again no communication even so been promised twice that will be contacted. Terrible customer service, no respect for customers, never buying from HP again. Terrible experience."
525,Never had worst customer service experience for any device or appliance. Paid two years for extended warranty but they determined it was accidental damage after being shipped to service center. They are not releasing the unrepaired laptop with display issues after two weeks and barely any communications. Have no clue why they don't repair or ship back without repairing. Only paid around $550 for the laptop on black Friday but they determined the repair would be $497 to repair a display monitor. A total mess and now as much as I love HP products have deep doubts about HP's good effort to service their customer's products under warranty.
526,"These pirates tried to charge me $99.00 just to ASK ONE SIMPLE QUESION!!!! Do they think I'm some kind of idiot to pay a big fat Benjamin just to ask if my system memory can be increased on my HP computer??? I'll never buy an HP product again!  Never, ever!!! I don't do business with shysters. I cannot believe you have the kahunas to do that! You clowns should go out of business for ""customer service"" like this!!! My apologies to TrustPilot for the emotion in this review but its hard not to express some anger for the absolute horrific product support that HP tried to swindle me with. Just pitiful."
527,"They fool you to buy from them through cashback websites like topcashback, so they look competitive compared to other manufacturers, the don't pay up, been chasing the cash back for over a year and nothing. This sort of behaviour should be criminal as they're using false advertising to gain customers, shame on authorities not looking at what these giants are doing!"
528,"I have tried several times to speak to Sales and twice booked appointments, but on the appointed times when the link was opened, no-one came on the line. When I tried to ring them I was ""in a queue"" for so long that I gave up in the end. I  wanted to buy a laptop from them and just needed to ask a couple of simple questions first, but now having second thoughts if this is a good idea!"
529,"App works fine, but customer support is absolutely horrendous. You're put on hold, you're transferred to several departments. They sent us a cable from Germany, didn't work, they took control of my laptop to troubleshoot the problem. At least 5 different ""technicians"" have all tried the exact same techniques to troubleshoot. Every ""department"" is the exact same obviously, since they all try the exact same techniques, then say it's a specific problem for a different ""department"". 7 hours total of troubleshooting, and we are back on hold again, all we need is the defective printer they sold to us, replaced. Never buying an HP product again."
530,Don’t get a Hp computer if you want trouble free life costomer service is a joke ordered a new laptop early August and the charger that came with the laptop didn’t work so got on to customer service/tech support to get a replacement charger explained it was a usb type c and not a round pin end on the charger yes ok will send one out to you and what arrived yes a charger with a round pin so got back in touch with them and explained that they sent the wrong charger thay apologised and said they would send the right charger out but guess what they sent me the wrong charger again so don’t make the same mistake as I did buy a different make and have a trouble free life
531,"Bought an HP 13.3"" Envy x-360 convertible laptop on September 2021 which I paid for with PayPal. After 10 months of use the battery is not holding charge for as many hours as it used to do. Now after a full charge it holds charge for no more than a couple of hours. On August 22, 2022 I started a chat with an HP.com customer service technical support expert. After I explained the battery issue to the technician, roshni koyippurathu, and I gave him/her all the information requested from me - and after a 45 minutes chat, he/she said he/she was going to start a test over the internet and that it could take some 20 more minutes but perhaps even longer. I said ""you have got to be kidding me"". I clearly felt he/she was giving me the run-around, so I asked him/her to give me the name and phone number of his/her supervisor. He/she never did. He/she indicated he/she was going to arrange for a supervisor to give me a call. They never did. I am quite frustrated and disappointed at HP.com. They never gave me a solution to my battery issue; on the contrary, they just tried to get me tired so I would just hang up. - HP, NEVER AGAIN will I buy from you guys ever."
532,"I have an HP inkjet printer with the subscription service for ink. I needed new ink (though the agreement is they'll send you more before you run out). The website is totally frustrating--there's no easy way to just order the next cartridge. The automated chat is useless and the phone system is a long and frustrating series of repeated messages before at long last you get connected to someone in India. I have no complaints about the Indian man who finally answered--but I don't want to deal with the HP ""customer service"" system again."
533,"I am a creative and will NEVER EVER order from HP again!! The absolute worst customer service! I ordered a monitor and wanted to return it as I was not happy with the product. It took me over two weeks for an email reply to return the item. I have sent several complaints and nobody got back to me!!! After calling the customer service line it keeps on saying my waiting time was 10min, then 7, 5, and 2. But I've been waiting for over 30min now and nothing is happening! This is absolutely shocking considering it is such a big company."
534,"If there is anything lesser than a one star, this is what HP deserves. I bought a HP envy laptop for £1000 that I mainly use at the weekends. On my 2nd time on a conference call, the microphone stopped working exactly 1 month of purchasing the laptop. I didn't loose sleep because you don't spend £1000 on a laptop and expect it to have issues. The 2nd time the issue occurred was on the 14th August then I knew there was an issue. I raised it with Tech team and they couldn't resolve it and wanted the laptop repaired. At this point I requested an exchange given the issue occurred with a low frequency. I got referred to post sale and post sale redirected me to technical team without listening or any empathy. I waited 32mins for my call to get picked up only to be shoved over to technical team and to date I still have not had a response to my emails. All they were after is getting onto the next call. I am highly disappointed with HP customer service. I still have not had my issue resolved and HP has my hard earned money."
535,"I bought an HP all in one, as I needed a new pc, worst choice ever, it is so slow it's unbelievable. I had a job connecting to my Epson printer which was easy to use with my old Dell. Me being a complete idiot bought an HP printer, the whole package is completely unworkable and utter crap. One star is too many."
536,I agree with most of the other customers. The customer service experience is horrible. The reps are constantly looking for money and barely doing anything to help. Don't think your crazy dealing with the reps. The service sucks and hp should should be ashamed.
537,"After first review, it's painful to install but manageable. Still after installing the latest driver (required for Windows), you basically need to delete and reinstall the printer which was a pain"
538,"1star is also too much, highly disappointed with service . No show even after sheduling a service date. Engineer says he will visit but never came. Don’t ever think of buying an Hp printer or any product."
539,Bought a Printer with promise of 6 months free Ink only to find I have to sign up for a monthly plan.  Contacted them on whats aqpp and half way through the assistant stop responding to me.  WORST CUSTOEMR SERVICE EVER. Taking the printer back as it won't print anyway and buying a canon or an epsom.
540,Worst customer service cant talk to anyone
541,Worst customer service experience ever.I would definitely choose zero stars if possible. My experience with HP customer service has to be the worse I’ve ever had. I purchased an Omen desktop it arrived damaged and could not be used. It took HP 16 days to replace it without as much as a sorry. I stayed in 2 days one incorrect day for collection and the same for the replacement. Still no apology it took several Emails to get a response and a offer of a £50 voucher which could only be used on there website. I was told we will send an e-voucher ASAP which never happened. In between sending more email to secure my £50. The headphone jack and a usb port became faulty. To which i informed HP about there response was for me to contact technical. No offer to repair the desktop. At this point i informed HP that they needed to review there offer within  7 working days. I never received a response now hence my review. I would never recommenced HP very poor or non existence customer service. They take weeks to answer your Email or pass them to another department. They will only accept a complaint via Email you cannot talk to management direct  substandard products no backup.
542,As you can see.  Everyone feels the same dreadful.  Hate the customer service.  Hate their subscription models.  Literally hate everything about this company.
543,"All you have to do is call customer service before you buy anything and your experience will be dissatisfied, all they wanna do is get your name and your number That is far as it will go"
544,"I bought a desktop worth Rs 115000/- Bluethooth doesnt work so i check with microsoft to make sure its not software issue. Formated my desktop upgraded all the drivers, used hp's stupid virtual support but nothing. Customer service is the worst even the tech support using remote desktop couldnot solve it . Since that time they are send the engineer to sort the things out ... its been more than a week ... is the engineer coming via bullock cart ot by a cruise ship or coming from a differnt continent..."
545,"I have a HP Officejet 3831 which worked fine for a few years even after I switched to buying compatible ink cartridges. Recently, however, my pc stopped recognizing the printer even though it was connected directly by usb. To try to fix the issue I had to install HP Smart which pushed some software updates which fixed the connection problem but after a few pages decided that the ink cartridges are incompatible with this printer.I cannot afford to buy HP cartrridges and rarely use the printer and HP Instand Ink pushes you to buy more than you need."
546,"I would definitely choose zero stars if possible.  My experience with HP customer service has to be the worse I’ve ever had.  I purchased a replacement power cord on line.  When I went then to work the next day I realized it was the wrong one.  I called them and admitted that I had read their disclaimer about being only able to cancel within an hour of placing the order.  No problem.  But after terrible communication and constant dropping out of the call I told them just to initiate the return and I’d get the correct cord on line.  I received the cord and immediately sent it back as directed.  The refund email math didn’t add up so I called.  I swear they intentionally try to make it a very uncomfortable experience.  The hold music is obnoxiously loud, the customer service rep had excessive background noise including keyboard noises that in no way could match the information I was giving.  I was repeatedly put on hold.  Then they charged me a 15% restocking charge.  I understand that on computers etc but an unopened power cord????  Never ever using their website again."
547,DO NOT BY FROM HP!!!!! go to a store like Currys etc to obtain your computer.I purchased a laptop 3 months back. Was told it was delivered by parcelforce...it wasnt....contacted Parcelforce said it had been lost.....go back to HP for refund.... HP still refused refund....taking legal advice now.....as nobody from HP can give a straight answer and just do not tell truth on calls. Lets see if they have the bottle to return a response to me!!!
548,"I bought a product from the online store. Receive it the next day. I open it and try it. The product is defective. I try to log my problem on the HP customer service system using the serial number on the product. The serial number is not recognized. I call customer support and manage to talk to a person after a few attempts as the line dropped and there was no option for my type of product. The agent does not find the product with its serial number but finds it using the product number. The agent tells me the product is out of warranty which is nonsense given I had bought the product the week before. The agent insists the product is out of warranty but tells me she'll do me a favor and extend it. Then she takes my details and tells me she has to take over my computer remotely to do some tests which I refuse as I am using a work computer with sensitive information on it. She tells me she has to take over my computer anyway. I cannot believe the amount of time I spent for no result. Anywhere else on the planet you buy something and can return it with no issue especially if the product is defective. Apparently, HP doesn't care."
549,"Bought a HP desktop 2.5 years ago and it cant be upgraded to windows 11. It crashes regularly and support is non-existent. Stupidly, I bought a HP laptop too, and the sales experience was horrific. Took more than a month to get my order resolved. The customer service was nothing but mindless call center people reading off scripts. Bought a Lenovo laptop for my wife and it was a much better experience and the laptop was less expensive and had better specs. I always liked the way HP's look (aesthetically) but their support and software is sub-average."
550,Only because zero stars isn't an option. I have been trying for months to get rid of all the HP programs on my laptop. But still in the background it goes through your search history. Freezing the screen while snooping. And keeps defaulting to Microsoft Edge as my search engine. Bought a Lenovo laptop to use while away. Perfect. HP are using my data for marketing.
551,"I'd give no stars if I could.I spent a small fortune on an all-in-one desktop only to find the keyboard was faulty. I called the next day to get a replacement keyboard. They won't replace parts. I have to send the whole computer back. They booked a collection date without agreeing the date with me, which happens to be a day that I'm not home. Returns take 5 - 7 days. And they won't send the new item until the faulty one has been 'received'.I have a computer I can't use. The collection process is shambolic. All this time they have my money.You can only complain by email. And as you can imagine, getting through to speak to someone in the post sales team is mentally draining. My average wait time to get through was 35 minutes.I suggest you never buy directly from HP. Their processes and procedures are not designed for the needs of consumers. They are more suited to transactions with businesses. If you have to buy a HP product get it from a retailer such as John Lewis or Argos. Their return and swapping policies are much more individual friendly.ZERO stars from me to HP."
552,hp will not support anything you own after a few years. drivers can't be downloaded. doesn't even support their own links. if you want to waste your money then buy their crap.  just another corp taking our money making us take it.
553,"Sorry to say it, but never again. HP used to be good, but not now. I am never going back. I bought a printer, the HP deskjet 2700 series. I was given wrong information. I was told there is no way to operate this with a direct cable. Th opposite is true. The cable is essential to the setting-up process. It should have been included. I bought one online. To set up this supposedly wireless-only printer was a nightmare, and took many hours with people who really knew what they were doing. They advised me to never go back to HP, and I won’t. After many hours of frustration and being sent in repetitive circles, it does now print, very slowly and with many intermittent problems that I assume are to do with the driver and not the hardware.The paper feed is useless. You nearly have to feed each sheet one by one. I tried everything. Glitches and refusals to print happen very often. Laptop restart required often.  Those who helped me, and I, all of us advise you to go elsewhere."
554,"Please allow me to add my voice to the chorus of 1-star reviews for this company. We have an OfficeJet Pro 8600 (4-in-1) printer. The printing and copying functions are fine. The fax function is obsolete at this point, but that's not HP's fault. What HP is responsible for is some breathtakingly bad decisions regarding the scan function. It used to be extremely easy to scan a document with this printer: just place it on the glass and press scan. Not anymore. HP reached (virtually) into my scanner without my permission or approval and literally changed how it operates. Now it ONLY can scan thru an application on my laptop - and even requires users to set up an account! Way to shake customers down for their big data, HP. Even worse still, the scan function went from something that took seconds to literally several minutes per page. It is just painful to create even a 2-page document. Very disappointing. Not buying this brand again."
555,I had purchased the hp laptop and it started giving me issues after using it for 11 months. I approached the hp service center during the warranty period.These people kept the laptop with them for 15 days and were still unable to resolve the issue.I have  also mailed to hp support still the issue is not resolved yet. I am a working women and all this is affecting my performance.The issues is still unresolved.Whats the use of such a company having engineers who are unable to solve the issue..Shame on your guys. You should sit in a barbers shop and chop hairs as you guys don't know how to resolve my laptop issues.. PATHETIC EXPERIENCE. VERY DISAPPOINTING.I WOULD NEVEE RECOMMEND HP LAPTOPS TO ANY OF MY FAMILY OR FRIENDS.FRAUDSTER YOU ARE.
556,"I bought a screen from HP.The product wasn't what I expected, so I went on their site and spoke to a chat agent after having it for about 10 days. All fine.They got my address to send me return packaging. Nothing arrived after a week. I got in touch with the Post Sales department and they say that they can't process my return because I'm requesting it after 14 days and they have no record of my return request.Now I'm fighting them to get access to the chat history as I didn't take any screen shots of the chat. Way to ensure that someone will hate HP forever and will tell all of their friends never to buy HP because you have to fight them to get your money back even if you're in the right."
557,Waste of money buying hp laptop. My laptop is in extended warranty and still the hp is not helping and making excuses your number is not reachable and all.
558,"Yesterday I was insulted, talked down to and asked for access to areas that had nothing to do with my printer getting connected wireless.  I have an hp chrome book and a enyy printer. I spent over a week attempting to get the printer online. I finally called hp support and after an hour of no results and being asked to buy another printer. The tech asked for access to my banking infor. I asked what that has to do with connecting. I was talked to in such an insulting manor and he attempted to tell me my equipment was to old. Just bought the printer about a week and a half ago, chromebook little over a year ago.  I took the printer back! Don't recommend hp support, unless you was to be insulted or up sold."
559,"I bought a HP 14-dq0000 at what I thought was a great price and it worked well for about 90 days. Then a problem developed with the on/off switch, so I contacted HP through the warranty information provided. What a mistake. I have never been treated so rudely and felt like I was dealing with elementary age school children. I chatted with 3 - 5 people and each time was made to start over providing name, address, serial#, model#, etc. etc. etc. You get the idea. A waste of time designed to frustrate you and make you go away. Each person I spoke with insisted I forward them a video of the problem so they could properly diagnose the problem. What nonsense - a video of a blank screen? How helpful. I tried to reason with each person I spoke with, but to no avail.  Each step of their process is carefully thought out to frustrate the customer and hope they give up and go away. You can get no help at all from them. A total waste of time. Honestly based on my experience I would not purchase another HP product. The warranty is worthless, and the customer service is in dire need of a total make over. Far better brands on the market with much more concern for their customers."
560,"My first contact with HP was via Whatsapp and I explained my printer was brand new and broken. The representitivve said they had organised for a new one to be sent and a collection to be made. Two weeks later nothing had happened. I contacted a second time via phone and it was one of the worst customer experiences of my life. Multiple convoluted options going to multiple departments, customer services, logistics team, post sales, etc etc. I spoke to at least 4 different people. Every person I spoke to had no idea what I was talking about even though I provided a case ID, name and email address. NO ONE helped me and everyone said i would be contacted by someone else. I got an email from someone in Germany? (I live in the UK) who tried to help me, but they never replied to any of my emails, and still haven't to this day.Other than that no one ever contacted me so I got in touch once again via whatsapp. I was told I would be contacted within 48-72 hours. Again no one contacted me. So i got in touch again this time I was pretty annoyed and wouldn't leave the chat until this was resolved. The assistant finally orgaised a replacement printer which has now arrived. He said someone would contact me about collecting the fault printer. Guess what? No one contacted me. So i got in touch again (this is the fifth time) and the representiive said I would have to dispose of the printer myself using a 'local recycling facililty'. I said this was not what i had been told previously and after a long wait he said someone would contact me about collecting the fauilty printer. I can't tell you how many times i've been told ""someone will contact you"" I sitll have the broken printer at home and no one, HP or UPS have been in touch about collecting it. It took me 15 mins to buy the printer and two days for it to arrive. It's taken me nearly a month to get it replaced and the broken one is still sitting on my floor.The impression I got from HP support was that it was total chaos."
561,Am very annoyed with HP Smart INk they're cancelled my subscription and they're say they're can do that when they're did gor this email and I still got 6 months I lost that new and they're what add it back to some INk they're keep telling me it's being cancelled that is just a waste of INk that not being used and they're ended the chat without fixing the issue
562,"The Deskjet printer/scanner I have, doesn't want to print anymore after upgrading to Windows 11, the HP Smart app doesn't recognise my printer, scanning unavaliable, I had to re-install it, and therefore, same thing!! After painstakingly getting rid of HP Smart and re-installing it, it's the same formula over and over again!!Get a printer/scanner from a different manufacturer, like the Japanese upstart, EPSON! Avoid Stateside upstarts like HP, they used to make great kit but it's a pain in the neck!!"
563,Don't ever make the mistake of enrolling into the Instant Ink. All sounds wonderful BUT these brainless prats are NOT capable of collecting payment. I have submitted 4 or 5 payment cards ALL OF WHICH HAD THE REQUIRED MONEY AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES but Hopeless Prats are incapable of collecting it. HP is a dreadful company the lap top I bought is cracking in two - and every product they offer including Instant Ink is flawed. they truly are a s*** company the Customer Service is non-existent and they don't give a s***  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE go to a real computer company like DELL.  4058 Reviews and 90% BAD. That is an absolute disgrace. I REST MY CASE
564,"Their staff lie, and make promises and do not fulfil them. I spoke to 7 people, and only one called back. Even their customer relations said they would send an email with their complaints address aand they did not.  They are a joke.They need to arrange mystery shoppers to test how their staff do not follow-up on actions. It is so disppointing. I won't buy theur product again I am actually traumatised with the experience and have lost faith in in the HP brand."
565,"Would give -1 if I could. Bought 03/2022: stopped working 06/07/2022; Called support-fixed for 2 wks. then died again-2 hrs. 10 min on phone: Put on side and bought cheap printer to get by until I had time to waste with another support call: 08/02/2022 called again was on phone for 2 hrs. 5 min-agent logged in to my system did whatever he needed to do and did a restart which we lost connection--never called me back. I called later got new agent on phone for 1 hr. 20 min, did her thing then wanted me to call my satellite provider to reset WiFi. She would call me back the following afternoon....NO return call. I called back the next day, explain all the goings on. Was on phone for another 3 hrs. 5 min. to no avail. When asked to call satellite company again, I drew the line.I still have 20 months of warranty left but am being stonewalled with wasting time with fixes that don't work."
566,"Purchased a laptop through ebay name hpstoreuk , the item was advertised as brand new but was faulty,  the screen was flickering and fuzzing.It looks like the item was a faulty return from another customer. I think HP is using ebay as a gateway to sell customer faulty returns in the hope of getting away with itYou can't advertise as brand new when it was clearly used and faulty.I have tried contacting them numerous times via ebay and the customer care line and no one gets back. This review won't be taken down until my complaint has been resolved.I needed a laptop urgently for my buisness."
567,"Ink cartridges and HP printers... expensive right? So expensive that they make sure that you cannot use other non-HP cartridges inside them. They try to scam with 'Ink Instant'... money money money. I have just gone onto their website hoping to 'chat online' but speaking to a human is impossible. HP is making a fortune on us... the everyday homeowner who is trying to get by. I just called tech with one simple question 'how do I see how many pages I have printed since my last purchase of ink cartridges on my HP Envy 4500e' printer screen'. Apparently, an impossible question to answer without knowing if I have 'ink instant' and what is the serial number of my machine. The entire exercise is so painful that, after several years of owning the printer - it going in the bin. Actually, better yet... in the garden with my hammer. Just for a little bit of release since I can't get my hand on that super rich guys who is milking us all"
568,"I have had an HP printer for four years. It now says download new drivers. I have spent ages trying to download, I have tried to contact them. It just goes blank. Virtual assistance a waste of time.Goodbye HP.You are rubbish"
569,"Paid just over £440 to have my laptop fixed. I was told I would receive a phone call to discuss pickup but that never happened, no communication from DPD delivery either to say when this would be picked up. Luckily I checked the DPD app and the details were on there. I was told my laptop would be fixed and sent back to me within 6-10 working days, however, after calling them today (day 5) for an update they have said they don't have the parts and will take 5 weeks. I wish I would have gone to a local business to have my laptop fixed. I would advise anyone wanting to have their laptop fixed to go through a different company, and not HP. Not only would I not use this service again but I would not buy another HP laptop as the one I have is terrible and has basically fallen to pieces after just 1 year. I purchased it new at a cost of just under £1,100"
570,"I would highly recommend that you spend your money elsewhere. This company may need to be investigated. They might be engaging in the same practice as Apple, interfere with your software to slow or disable your device, to force you into upgrading. We have not used our printer excessively- don’t think we have printed 600 pages on it in the three years that we have owned it. Shortly after the extended warranty ended, the printer died. Called HP for support but there was none given. If you want a product that will last a wee bit longer than three years, consider a different brand. Please heed my warning and save yourself some time and headaches."
571,"Yet another awful report on HP, we’ve found that their ‘customer relations’ to be beyond belief in the incompetence they display. 4 hours on the phone getting the run round, a pi** up in a brewery springs to mind, you get passed from one department to another. They used to make good test equipment, now they make awful computers!"
572,"I haven't even had this 2-in-1 laptop for 6 months before the screen started going out and the computer was barely used.  When I contacted HP because it was still under warranty, you will not believe how many times I got hung up on or told it was my fault that a barely used laptop broke and that I would have to pay $490, the cost of a new laptop mind you, to get it fixed.  I wish i would have read the reviews on HP as a company and how horrible they are.  They deserve no stars."
573,"2 HP laptops failed within 6 months, 1 with a faulty screen and the other had 2 keys come off. HP on both occasions stated that I had damaged the laptops and they weren't covered by the warranty and I would have to pay. The repair cost was as much as a new laptop. So going to throw their sub standard goods in the bin and buy new laptops from a proper company!!!"
574,Rip offs take your cash then fob you off when you want a product fixing while under warranty paid £800 for all in one 27” only to be told they could repair it for £490 although it was in warranty stay clear of big items from them never again
575,"I bought a defective HP printer in August of '21(!).  Although tech support has never been able to fix  multiple self decrisbed issues they will neither refund nor replace this piece of junk.  Tech support is rude, completely ignorant andcould care less. They pass you from one person to another who are all knownothings. Never been so disrespected.  They lie or delay on just about e erything.  NEVER believe what they tell you."
576,"I am now 7 days and counting into my efforts to change the credit card from where instant ink repayments are being taken.  Still unresolved after hours of my time and numerous support engagements have failed to resolve an issue.  Similar experience previously when my credit card expired and HP blocked my printer from working without telling me why.  Could have been resolved in seconds, but took hours because of terrible customer communication from HP.  HP also took increased payments from my account without notification and duplicate payments on the same day without explanation.  This happened 6 weeks ago at the time of writing and is also still unresolved with HP support just outright ignoring me. Completely and totally unacceptable ""service"". Avoid if you can."
577,I will never buy from hp again. You want to charge me monthly for technical support. On a laptop I purchased a 3 year warranty on. Just to be told technical support and troubleshooting is not covered.  How the hell is that even possible. What a kind of malarkey is that I regret spending alot 600 dollars on this laptop. Worst company I've ever had to deal with. Worthless.
578,"I purchased an HP laptop direct from the company, and all was well for a while. hen I started experiencing wifi connectivity issues at home. Only with the HP. Not with four other computers, or six phones, all of which stay connected. If you contact HP customer service, they insist the issue isn't the computer, it's the wifi that is connected to half a dozen other devices. They pretend to troubleshoot. One of the people I spoke to said just connect through your phone hotspot. Super solution.Every time I contact customer service, not only is the process difficult, but also the lack of caring and lack of plausible solutions is more than frustrating. I've opened complaints and been told ""a manager will call you and help you today."" I was told that on three separate occasions. Three months later, I'm still waiting for them to call.I've never experienced so many issues and had a company care so little about them. So, the moral of the story is, don't just check specs of a computer, check into whether or not you'll be able to get any assistance after the sale if you - inevitably - have an issue. With HP, when you're frustrated with your computer, when you try and get help to fix it, your frustration will explode a thousand-fold."
579,"Terrible service when purchasing an in-stock laptop. Recently i decided to purchase a laptop direct from HP for my niece as a birthday gift (for study & gaming), when i placed the order I made sure it was in-stock and it was stated to arrive in 2 days.On the day of delivery as i hadn't received any tracking i checked the site and my order was still ""processing"", as such i spoke with support who stated they'd raise this with the warehouse and advised my order would ship within 24hrs.The next day as my order was still not shipped, i contacted again and was advised that somehow the FREE care pack offer the laptop came with was blocking the shipping of the order and this had been corrected and my order would ship today.Later in the afternoon i received an email (hoping it would be the shipping confirmation) but this instead was an order delay email. After speaking with support again they advised the issue was the free care pack again (that was meant to have been fixed) and my order will now not ship for 48hrs (taking it into the weekend in which they don't ship).Due to these issues i cancelled my order, and despite taking my payment via PayPal instantly - i now have to wait 5 working days for the refund to be issues.I will not be buying direct from HP.com ever again."
580,I really regret buying an HP printer. I'm having issues after only 6 months and the support is atrocious. After 30 minutes trying to get to a human they are taking 8 minutes everytime I reply.
581,"Worst customer service ever. Don't ever trust what it says for delivery on their website. For me it said delivery within 2 working days but it has been more than 15 days now ! And a standard response after 45mins of wait on the call, that they have no response back from warehouse. Never buying directly from HP ever again."
582,Called HP today regarding my power adapter overheating. The whole process to was unnecessarily complicated and protracted. When I eventually did speak to someone human she could barely speak English and even then couldn't help me because her systems were down!HP - sort yourselves out please!
583,"Sales support is fine but there is a total lack of technical or warranty support. If something goes wrong your stuck. Automated phone service is unusable. Tried to book return online, this was confirmed, but have no idea if or when they intend to collect as no carrier has been in touch days later despite my booking the collection day… No way to speak to somebody or email them. Shocking, never again. I am tempted to raise a claim with Amex."
584,Worst service providing by HP laptops lot of  time taking service providers. Very irresponsible support team.shortage of spares at service centre stores.Not at all responsive when asked for support
585,Very irresponsible service I have complaint 3 months back but till no response
586,"Non existent customer service, even the retailer confirmed my opinion. Buyer beware!"
587,I have sent a Pc in for repair around 26.06.22- it has been a month and i have not been contacted by HP. the online repair status is not helpful at all as it has not even been chnaged since the day they recieved the pc. i have contacted HP via virtual chat and whastapp as well as calls. and none of the staff know whats happening.  very bad service. never going to buy from them. rather spend more money on an apple or samsung device.
588,"I was a long time customer of HP.  My printer had a hardware problem where the carriage got stuck.  After 1-1/2 hours on the phone they figured out they could not fix it and recommended I buy a new printer.  The printer was practically new right before the pandemic and it essentially was not used during the pandemic because I work for Broadway.  They were unwilling to offer any discount on a new printer.  On top of that, they then charged me for for ink when the printer was broken for the majority of of the time period.  Bad, Bad, Bad.  I will never buy another HP printer and I was a long time customer.  I asked them to reimburse me for the monthly ink charge and they then disconnected me. Then I called back and I got disconnected again."
589,"Not only is Instant ink a rip off if you allow it to expire it locks up your printer until you replace carts with store bought.  HP Smart is dumb.  According to the printer there is connection, and on my computer screen it is listed, but HP Smart can't find it.  Won't scan (aagain can't connect), but it prints of the computer just fine.  I'll avoid them in the future."
590,"Bought HP laptop 3 years ago and it has given  nothing but trouble ever since. Can take over an hour to fire up even though I returned everything to factory settings a few months ago. Often refuses to respond to servers and is very slow. Although technically it still operates I have had no option but to purchase another laptop as I can no longer stand the aggravation with this load of rubbish.Existing printer not compatable with new Lenovo laptop so I have had to buy new printer and only one available at PC World was an HP. Another faulty machine. Set it up ok and it printed off wirelessly fine. Next time I went to use it the printer showed as offline and would not work. Reset it all up again and it worked fine for 3 days and then failed again. Tried again to reset but unable to do so and paid a very experienced IT specialist to sort it in case I was at fault. He tried for over 2 hours in numerous  ways but like myself was unable to set up and has said the printer must be faulty. We did change BT network connectionto 2.4 gh, not difficult to do, but still no luck. Never ever will I buy another of their rubbish products!"
591,"Beware - no HP printers connect to 5G. I have just spent half an hour on the phone to HP support.  The agent herself was very pleasant and helpful, however ultimately I was told the HP printer I have could not connect to my 5G network.  They told me I would have to contact my internet provider and get my line split, so I could receive 2.4 - because that's all HP printers can connect to.  I told them their printer should be able to connect to my network otherwise the printer is useless.  I asked for a refund (under the 1 year warranty).  HP said I'd have to contact my supplier (who did give me a refund).  However, I think HP should have given the refund - it's their printer!! I repeat - no HP printers connect to 5G."
592,Had the monthly subscription plan where they claim to send you a new cartridge BEFORE your existing ones run out.Ran out of black with no sign of a replacement.Contacted them and although I passed all the security checks they couldn't order me a new cartridge as I was in work so couldn't give them the serial number of my home printer (which is saved on my account).Contacted them again requesting a black cartridge - jumped through endless hoops and a few days later received a colour cartridge.Went through endless not chats trying to get it sorted but it took a month in all Cancelled my subscription as the service was so poor - only to be told that the new cartridge I had battled to get would stop working when my subscription ended even though it was installed.HP print subscription is a scam and the customer service is appalling - avoid like the plague!
593,Service assistance clients impossible à joindre malgré plusieurs tentatives.
594,"The printer in not user friendly, it is too involved to print a simple document. It took 15 minutes of trying to print a document, before I gave up. I never printed the document and this has happened on several occasions. THIS IS THE WORST PRINTER I'VE EVER PURCHASED. I HATE THIS PRINTER. If anyone asks I will tell them to NEVER. Purchase this printer. And this is from a loyal HP customer. The printer is HP Deskjet 2742e. Absolutely awful."
595,"FRUSTRATING!!! Like other similar reviews, trying to print and scan with these new HP's is 100% terrible.  Waste of time and a sure method to get your blood pressure up.  Printing with HP was better in 2016 vs. 2022.  This is a step backwards.  HP ought to read these reviews and make immediate changes.  Shame on you HP and your idiot engineers."
596,CAN NOT CONNECT CAN NOT PRINT CAN NOT DO ANYTHING BIGGEST LOAD OF CRAP EVER
597,"I had an HP Photosmart 7762 for many happy years. Like an idiot I thought I'd replace it with another HP printer. It's nothing but trouble. First you must connect to the internet to set it up and install it. Then you have to download lots of apps. The Instant Ink is anything but and they don't warn you when you're approaching your limit, so you suddenly find yourself charged much more than the pre-arranged amount. Then, when you cancel, you can no longer use the cartridges they supplied. EVERY time I try to scan, there are problems - usually the HP software cannot find the HP machine! And forget about using any other scanning app - no way! The support is absolutely useless - everything depends on apps. Save yourself grey hairs, stress and money - avoid HP!"
598,"I've had a bit of a frustrating time trying to get a laptop repair sorted but spoke to the nicest, most helpful customer service agent this afternoon who has put my mind at ease and was very warm while being very professional and capable - shout out to Jamal!"
599,"I tried to get support to order the right charger for my (slightly older) laptop. No one felt responsible to assist me, directing me to websites and people that couldn't help either.What I was looking for was just someone to give me simple advice of what product I should be looking for. No one seemed to have technical knowledge, rather focused on sales and presentation of items. Very unstructured for a simple query."
600,"I ordered a print cartridge for my large HP plotter. Thirteen days later, I got it but had to go to the post office to pick it up. It came from Middleton, TN, which is 365 miles from me, and my trip planner says I could drive it in 6.5 hours. If you chose Fedex as the shipper, your problems are only just beginning. Fedex got it to the Kansas City area, 3.5 hours from where I live. Then for some strange reason, they handed it off to the USPS. Those are two versions of the same abyss. My advice, get your cartridges filled by the guy who works out of the trunk of his car. You will at least not be dead in the water for 13 days."
601,"I bought an HP Pavilion x360 in January 2022. In June 2022 (6 months later) it suddenly shut down and would not restart. I tried several processes with HP Support (they were polite and tried to help) but nothing worked. Although I had a one-year warranty, HP would not honor it because I bought the laptop in Florida, but I am currently in South America. Turns out, the warranty is only good in the country where you buy the computer, even though HP is an international company. I had to pay out-of-pocket to fix my laptop. The warranty was worthless and HP didn't stand behind its product. Digital nomads are out of luck if their HP dies while traveling. Very disappointing!"
602,"Have you ever had to spend at least (I mean AT LEAST) 30 minutes every time you want to print something setting things up from the start? Go buy a HP printer to get the experience. When tried to contact customer support, a robot answered you and kept repeating the wrong serial number. And good luck trying to speak to an ACTUAL person!"
603,"I purchased the computer a little over a year ago, it is very slow, and I think that maybe something didn't go right when I turned it on for the 1st time. I talked to customer service while I still had a warranty but they could barely speak/understand English. I had to explain the situation many times over and it was never resolved. I think that it would be a good computer if something hadn't went wrong initially. I wish that I could have understood the customer service rep better. Also in fairness to HP I am not super tech savvy. I do own a printer/fax/copier from HP that I love."
604,"I purchased an HP product about a year ago, specifically the HP x360. I have been a customer for 30 years and I have never encountered such shoddy quality and service, within a month of ownership I had to send it to HP to get it repaired due to the constant disconnecting from the wi-fi, soon after the screen spontaneously turned white and the laptop became inoperable for a considerable amount of time. A year later was the final nail in the coffin this happened when the screen separated from the laptop lid, with the hinges not allowing the top half to close, I have repeatedly messaged HP regarding this matter, with long waiting time and unsatisfactory responses. I cannot stress enough that one must avoid Hewlett Packard products, it seems over the years they have become a shadow of their former self."
605,"Purchased a hp envy after 3 months, it's faulty. Clearly the device is badly built. HP requested that I send it to hp for repair,it came back with same problem. Again,it's been sent for repairs for the 2nd time,this time there is shortage of components till months  later.if only I had read the reviews here I would never have purchased any hp device.worst customer service too.Cant believe such a company is allowed to dell their faulty devices to customers"
606,"It’s the Voice of Customer. I purchased a HP laptop online for £399.98 on 26 June but never delivered. They said the order has not gone through but the money of course was paid in full to HP! They did not refund the money yet as of 7 July!It's not my business to remind the HP management that HP UK has been UNABLE to sell, or how the sale team's poor performance is. They probably know better, I just needed to get my money refunded.I was told that I will get refunded 3-5 working days since 28th June, but that never happened.They even deleted the order number from the sale database!!!  I don’t know why HP do this sort of stuff to poor customers ?!I hope I can get the money back from HP UK. I promise not to repeat my mistake to buy any of their products. Based on my horrible experience I recommend not to approach HP. They can not sell…"
607,I bought an HP printer online a couple of months back. The printer stopped working and HP support does not assist me to resolve the issue or providing the replacement. Never buy from HP. Waste of time
608,"Don’t under any circumstances buy a HP all in one computer! Only had mine for a year and a half, went to turn it on and the power says it’s on but blank screen, couldn’t get it to work, took it to a computer store to get fixed and they said it was un fixable! as the computer was past its 1 year warranty HP didn’t want to know! Avoid at all costs!! You’ve been warned!"
609,"I ordered a  HP plus deskjet 2722e on the 25/02/2022.It was ordered from a Argos store.It stated The printer was £59.99 plus 6 months ink.As of todays date (05/07/2022) I have only received one pack. !Well do NOT be fooled by this offer.I was told I was not using the printer enough a month to get cartridges sent out to me.What a con.I feel very misled by this advert. Totally disgusted at taking my money in this way. As a OAP  I could do without this stress of being misled and cheated out of my money. 🤬🤬🤬I had to give a one star to enable me to put this message on, otherwise it would have been a 0"
610,"Incredibly bad customer service. My HP Envy X360 laptop stopped working suddenly after a Windows 11 update on May 2nd. When I initially contacted HP to repair it they made me sit through countless video calls with Tech Support.When they finally conceded they could not repair it through standard means, they sent me a return label and kit to send it back. Once they received it, they informed me they had NO RECORD of a return!? After numerous calls to their customer support line they ""found"" it in their system.They proceeded to inform me that they would process a refund since their team could not figure out how to fix it. That was on June 16th. Today on July 5th I have come to learn via yet another phone call with HP, that they have not even PROCESSED the refund. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?May 2nd to July 5th. No LAPTOP, no REFUND. The entirety of the HP customer service department is WORTHLESS."
611,"Bought a £2.5k touchscreen PC direct from HP online. Set it up, no wi-fi. Tech support diagnosed missing network card. Reluctantly agreed to an on-site repair. It never happened, so I told them I wanted a replacement instead. Which is where the fun really began. Six months and literally dozens of emails and phone calls later I still have a useless piece of junk sitting boxed up in my living room awaiting replacement, which they already agreed to. Have escalated ad nauseum and spoken to Online Support, Sales, Post Sales, Customer Relationship Team (haha), Technical Support and even wrote to CEO. I've been bounced from pillar to post but not one single person will take responsibility for effecting a straightforward replacement of defective goods. They're now telling me to return it to my HP reseller, despite the fact that I bought it direct from HP online. Nothing else for it but to take legal action now. Defies belief."
612,I bought a printer and fell for the cartridges subscription offer. Definitely not worth the money so I cancelled. This morning I received an email stating that my PAID cartridges will stop working and they require me to send them back any spares that I still have. How is this legal?
613,"HP computer service is the worst in the world!I bought a HP laptop, placed an order on the HP website on 11/28/2021, bought an HP ENVY x360 Convertible Laptop - 15t-ed100 laptop, shipped to me on 9th December from China, I received this computer on 16th December Notebook, Serial Number: CND1481CTK. But it took only 2 months for the laptop to break, no internet access, and no sound from the speakers. It was sent to HP repair station for repair on March 19, 2022, and it was not repaired for more than 3 months! It was not until June 28, 2022 that I was asked to pick it up and said it was repaired, and I have been waiting for 100 days! , but I took the laptop home for testing, and I could access the Internet for a while, but not for a while. Finally, the laptop showed that the hardware was broken. What should I do? Paid $855 for a malfunctioning thing that couldn't be repaired!For this repair notebook, the repair time of 100 days (more than 3 months) is too long. What's worse is that it has not been repaired, and I still cannot access the Internet. The computer indicates that the network adapter hardware is faulty. I have crashed and I have no confidence to repair this computer again. , Requirements: Replace with another model laptop!I'm sure this is the worst service in the world, because I used to be a senior supervisor of computer and notebook repair services. For notebook repairs, there is a quick 2-hour repair, stand and wait, and the repair will be completed immediately. If it can't be completed in 2 hours, transfer to Repairs are completed within 3 working days, and 90% of laptop repairs are completed within 3 working days!Never seen the worst service in the world like HP!"
614,"The hardware is garbage, and I waste so much time trying to get it to work."
615,"I purchased an HP laptop less than 90 days ago, and have had problems since the beginning. I’ve been talking to tech support since the day I took it out of the box, but since I did not buy it straight through them apparently I am screwed. They will not fix it, they will not replace it, they will not repair it!! The Tech Support that I should have been getting was awful and now I’m being told I don’t have any recourse. Got a love a $700 paperweight."
616,"Purchased an HP printer about a year ago for my low volume printing, maybe 3 pages a month. I enrolled in the HP ink refills.  I received my 1st and only refill, it felt empty, I thought it was just how they took care of low volume printing needs. A couple months later I tried to print and it was spotty, ink wasn’t really coming out.  I took the ink to OfficeMax to get an opinion, they said it was empty.  So. Now I waited for new ink.  Never came. I bought ink, and because I am enrolled in ink program, I can’t use purchased HP ink from store.  I looked at my account and they are charging me, but no ink for three more months.  I tried to find somewhere to get more ink, there is no one to contact and you are not allowed to speak to anyone, even though they are charging you for a service.  After 10 months I cancelled my ink subscription and now have a printer that will not work because I can’t buy ink and HP won’t send any.  INSANE"
617,Can’t get my HP printer to scan to anything but also can’t get any kind of real support. The service is diabolical. Driving me mad. Really frustrating. It all used to work great but as soon as there is a problem it says that their help and support system is down! How bad is that!
618,I have handed over my laptop on may 28th regarding display change and its july 1st now still they are saying that they haven’t got the spare display …. Am in banglore ..is this a good service ??
619,HP is an awful company that makes dreadful products that don't work and waste your time.
620,Bought a new monitor and keyboard set. Good price and delivery Products are satisfactory and do the job. I paid by debit card without any problems. An hour after I had put my order in I received an urgent message from my bank telling me to call them re-a card transaction. Upon speaking with the fraud department I was told there were three requests for differing amounts ranging from £160 down to £22. Spoke to an idiot at hp who promised to send me an email with a form to fill in. Hasn't sent any email. Obviously someone at hp has passed on my card details to a scammer. This is a very serious matter and they don't appear to be bothered. Great publicity for them.
621,"HP- SERVICE IS PATHETIC, NO ONE IS ANSWERING THE CALL, ALL WITH APP BASED AND VIRTUAL SERVICE. MY CASE NO.5087424889 IS CLOSED WITHOUT ATTENDING. I HAVE BRAND NEW JESKJET 2778 PRINTER, EVEN I LOAD ORIGINAL CATRIDGE, IT IS NOT TAKING THE PRINT COMMAND. GOT SICK OF CALLING THEM AND PRESSING 1,2.. AND LISTENING TO THE RING TONE. I APPEAL TO EVERYONE NOT TO BUY HP PRODUCT AT ALL, AS THEIR SERVICE IS VERY.. VERY POOR.NO ONE IS ATTENDING THE CALL"
622,hit or miss with tech support.Really need US Based support.
623,"Being on the phone for 3 hours 11:11-14:05, being transferred to different departments, wrong departments, is not a great feeling. Eventually managed to get to the bottom and hopefully the whole procedure will go smooth, where I will not have to call again and again.Staff members are always polite, but it is the procedure that makes everything so hard, where I have to be transferred to numerous departments, and explain everything over and over again, just to be told that this is not the right department and that I will be transferred to find out I have been transferred to the wrong department again."
624,I had too reinstall my 4500 Envy it used too be a simpleprocess but now its almost impossible.They are crazy the set up is absolutely ridicules how they expect olderpeople with very limited computer knowledge too understand any of that is beyond me.The people who set that up have not thought it out.I have given up with it.Stay away from HP products they will give youhigh blood pressure.
625,The worst support service I ever experienced. Support agents do not understand English or are not motivated to understand questions. They were forwarding me to their other support divisions which never existed or pages were broken.Communication was disconnected by agents without providing actual support.
626,"Purchased a i7 laptop in August 2021. I noticed a problem with the computer depleting the battery in 90 minutes, but until recently that was enough at any one time. Now I need it to run as per spec - 9 1/2 hours (not that I believed that) but 90 minutes was ridiculous. I used their support software - totally ignored. I tried their WhatsApp Social Media Support. For the next 8 days (not a mistake) I got do this, send this and that, then reinstall W11. Then sorry can't help closing support, telephone this number. Rang 7 times after as much as 18 minutes on hold, the call is dropped. I think this is worst experience with any hardware company. Okay Dell was like this 30 years ago."
