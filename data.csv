0,"-5 stars, HP Envy 6452e. Scanning issues are a nightmare. HP doesn't have a fix that lasts longer than a couple weeks maybe a month. Then it's back to ""tech support"" and hours downloading more software. I will never buy another HP printer combo even though I've used their printer/ scanners for 20 + years. Waiting to hear back from customer service for a refund."
1,"This is the worst experience that I ever had with a customer support. Incompetence only challenged by laziness and lack of manners. I promised myself not to buy anything HP anymore. Writing about the trouble I had with the HP support and my laptop would take several pages, but overall it's rubbish. I hope they go bankrupt, which they should."
2,On Monday 9th January 2023 I bought an HP Deskjet 3720 but the scanner is just horrible. Don't waste your money on garbage like this because it won't print either. On Tuesday 17th January 2023 I had to return it to the Bayswater Officeworks because I wasn't happy with this printer.
3,"My computer, which was still under warranty has been with HP for repair for more than 2 months now, waiting for parts; waiting for someone to try to repair it; waiting for someone to agree it needs to be replaced.  My dealer has had multiple emails with HP trying to speed up their decision-making. It is clear they are reluctant to replace it and each day I am without it is an inconvenience to me.  Their decision-making process needs to be streamlined so customers aren't left waiting so long for warranty replacements."
4,"What an awful company. I wish I had never given them any money for such a piece of crap printer, and now I’ve had to spend more money on ink and time on trying to get the printer to do anything, all resulting in nothing because their app won’t even connect my printer to the Wifi. Thanks you bunch of twts"
5,"I have a HP mobile printer and got the run around on getting support. I purchased an extended warranty then was told it would not cover my issue now.  They FINALLY supplied a support phone number to pay for support.  This was the biggest run around I have had in a long time.  If I ran my business this way, I would be out of business.  Shame on HP"
6,"I’ve used my pro book for almost 2 years and it’s been great. Haven’t really had any issues besides fixing the cooling fan at some point. Don’t like the repeated automatic updates whenever I connect to a wifi but either way, great product."
7,"If I can give this service a zero that would be my option. This is easily the worst customer service you'd ever receive. Avoid them like a plague, save yourself the time, money and energy."
8,"The instant ink subscription service is horrible. It has blocked my printer from printing with ink from their instant ink free trial. I was not aware that this would happen. I can't cancel my subscription because none of the buttons on the website are working correctly. I can't find a solution myself because I cannot translate the website into English (it's actually a PDF). The support chat is such a horrendous process with terrible answers and questions, when you finally get to a human they are also very very slow. I feel like they have hacked my printer just because of free ink they have offered me. It feels very much like a scam."
9,"HP MFP 4101fdwe DO NOT PURCHASEThis product does not connect to the HP Smart app, does not connect to the internet, and customer support has hung up on me over 10 times without answering my calls.  Edit: someone called me back and spoke to me over an hour, but did not solve my problem or offer any potential solutions.  Does not revise upward my rating."
10,"I have HP ENVY x360 in my possession, bought in May 2021 so the laptop is just about two years of normal domestic use and the screen just came apart at the right corner when I was trying to close it. I find it very strange and frustrating given the age of the laptop. This laptop in my view is coming short of the satisfactory quality I was expecting and it is definitely not fit for purpose, given the price I paid. I find this issue highly unacceptable for the age of the laptop and its normal daily use. I would expect HP to take accountability for this issue as I have seen they already have a class lawsuit in the US for the same. Customer service is far from helpful. Waited half a day on WhatsUp until someone was willing enough to respond to my query. Offered me two solutions, for which I would have to pay from my own pocket, despite the fact that the laptop is substandard quality to what was advertised. Now I have to wait days for you to respond with a repair quote...This is a really bad joke!!! On top of everything else, my laptop stopped charging a few days after so I have just lost access to my personal documents... HP!!! stand up to your promises of a great quality of product and service!!!..so far your service has been the same as the quality of the laptop: overhyped and substandard..."
11,"Yet another complaint about HP Smart Printer software.  It's not fit for purpose.  I've wasted days going around in circles with a printer that refuses to enable printing services until it is activated, however you can't obtain a pairing code to activate it.Eventually got through to HP support who said this printer has a dedicated team (that's a bad sign!) after a further 30 minutes on hold I eventually got through to someone who said everyone was busy and they'd call me back.  That was 2 days ago (and counting).  The printers are not fit for purpose and from the looks of it, they know it all too well but are burying their head in the sand.  HP are a disgrace.Day 3 & still no contact.  They are liars and rip-off merchants"
12,"App does not allow me to connect to my scanner!Just goes around in a loop, requesting you to 'return to home page'!Have used this scanner for years - it's a good scanner, but to connect via the app is a disaster"
13,2 Broken printers from manifacture. 5 hours of time wasted. The only offer refurbished printers to replace an existing one even if its a week old. Instant ink is also very poor.Sends a new one before the old has depleted and it could be half full. Aweful experieance an i am a computer tech.
14,"I have bought onsite support. My laptop will not start so I contacted HP support. They ordered a UPS pick-up, not onsite support. UPS arrived but did not have the collection box. They said they would be back, but 2 working days later and no UPS. I have since tried every option available on the HP website and support email and there is no way to contact them at all. I get a circular process that ends in no way to complain or communicate in any way. Complete rubbish support."
15,"Following up from my last review, case was accelerated.  Contacted by customer service who were incredible. Great outcome despite the stressful days of trying to sort out my issue. New cartridge sent and arrived. Thank you"
16,"It is slow as hell .I mean I would've understand it if it wasn't working high functioning tools like ae or genshin impact or any other thing. But bro settings? Even settings is lagging and you think the laptop will work.I wanted to on the night light but whenever I'm touching the night light ,it is chosen but is not opening even the whole setting app is just froze"
17,"Bought a HP Envy X360 laptop in October 2021.  The laptop has had light useage and is still in the condition it was purchased (excellent) apart from the hinge that holds the screen on the base has broken.  Was told that it would cost £440 to fix the hinge as it is a ""premium"" product.  The cost was for ""premium"" parts.  Obvious not premium parts used in the first place as it isn't fit for purpose.  I would not recommend HP as their after sales service is pants.  Never had such a bad service for such a ""premium"" product (HP's words - not mine)."
18,"Thanks for the hp desktop, Printer and hp laptop. I found it in budget price, easy to function, zero serviceability, good looking, compact, availability of cartridge, laptop is a good one."
19,From previous experience of using HP laptops the performance is ok but the battery life is shockingly bad.
